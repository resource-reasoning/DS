\subsection{\( SI \) is not intersection of \( \CP \) and \( \UA \) on dependency graph}
\label{sec:si-not-intersect-cp-ua}
We refer reader to \cref{sec:dependent-graph,sec:abstract-execution} for the full details of dependency graphs and abstract execution.
Here we show why when on abstract executions, the specification of \( \SI \) is intersection of \( \CP \) and \( \UA \), but it is not the case on specifications on dependency graphs.
