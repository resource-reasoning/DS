We introduce an interleaving operational semantics for describing the
client-observable behaviour of atomic transactions on distributed
key-value stores. Our semantics builds on abstract states comprising
centralised, global key-value stores and partial client views. 
Using our abstract states, we present operational definitions of well-known consistency models in the literature, 
and prove them to be equivalent to their existing declarative definitions using abstract executions. 
We explore two applications of our operational framework:
\begin{enumerate*}
	\item verifying that the COPS replicated database and the Clock-SI  partitioned database satisfy their 
consistency models using trace refinement, and 
	\item proving invariant properties of client programs. 
\end{enumerate*}
