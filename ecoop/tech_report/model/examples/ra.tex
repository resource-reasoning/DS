\paragraph{Read atomic (\(\RA\))}
This model \citep{ramp} is
a variant of \emph{eventual consistency} \citep{ev_transactions} for atomic transactions.
It is the weakest model we can capture, as \(\CanCommit[\RA] \) and \( \ViewShift[\RA] \) are always \true.
We sometimes write \( \TOP \) or \( \et[\TOP] \) for this model.
In contrast to \emph{atomic} in ACID \citep{acid} stating that a transaction \emph{takes effect} in one atomic step, 
\( \RA \) states that either none or all effect of a transaction is \emph{observed} by others.
\( \RA \) is also known as \emph{atomic visibility} or \emph{snapshot property}, 
since in the implementations of \(\RA\),
a transaction takes an atomic snapshot of the database at the beginning of the transaction,
and commits the effects at the end.

Read atomic is hard-wired in our semantics:
\begin{enumerate*} \item a view must include all or none of versions written by a transaction; and
\item in the atomic transaction rule, \rCAtomicTrans,
any intermediate steps of a transaction cannot be observed by other transactions.
\end{enumerate*}
\( \RA \) prohibits the kv-store in \cref{fig:ra-disallowed},
as transaction \( \txid' \) reads the second version of \( \key_2 \) carrying value \( \val_2 \),
but not the second version of \( \key_1 \) carrying value \( \val_1 \), 
which are both written by transaction \( \txid \).
