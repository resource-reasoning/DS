We define the program syntax in  \cref{sec:programming-language},
the semantics for transactional commands in \cref{sec:transaction-semantics},
and the semantics for programs in \cref{sec:program-semantics}.
Our semantics is parametrised by execution tests,
which are formally defined in \cref{sec:execution-test}.
