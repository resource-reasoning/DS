Dependency graphs \citep{adya} provide one well-known 
formalism for specifying consistency models. 
\citet{adya} originally used dependency graphs to model ANSI-SQL isolation levels,
which are the first formal and abstract definitions,
in contrast to previous definitions using reference implementations or anomalies.
