\emph{Abstract executions} \citep{ev_transactions,framework-concur} 
are an alternative declarative formalism for defining consistency models. 
We give the formal definition of abstract executions adopted from \citep{framework-concur}.
We then propose an alternative operational semantics on abstract executions in \cref{sec:aexec},
which is used in \cref{sec:kv-aexec-trace-equivalent,sec:sound-complete-et}
to prove correctness of our definitions of consistency models
with respect to the axiomatic definitions on abstract executions.
This alternative semantics is parametrised by an axiom \( \visaxioms \), which gives rise to a consistency model.
The goal is to prove the set of kv-store induced by an execution test
is equivalent to the set of abstract executions induced by an axiom.
Given \( \visaxioms \),
we show that the set of abstract executions induced by the alternative semantics
is the same set induced by applying the axiom directly to all possible graphs (\cref{sec:aexec}).
We show that the set of kv-store program traces under \( \et[\TOP] \)
is equivalent to the set of abstract executions test traces 
with the axiom being the maximum (\cref{sec:kv-aexec-trace-equivalent}).
We propose soundness and complete constructors,
in the sense that if an execution test \( \et \) and an axiom \( \visaxioms \) satisfy certain conditions,
these two constructors lift them to the level of traces.
Last, we use these two constructors to show that our definitions of consistency models are correct 
with respect to the definitions on abstract executions.
