The execution test \(\et[\WFR]\) is sound with respect to the axiomatic definition 
\(\visaxioms[\WFR] \Set{\lambda \aexec \ldotp \WR[\aexec] ; \Refl((\SO \cap \RW[\aexec] )) ; \VIS[\aexec] })\) 
\citep{surech-session-guarantee}.
By picking the invariant as \( I( \aexec, \cl ) = \emptyset \), the soundness and completeness
can be derived from \cref{thm:view-vis-relation} in a similar way as the proofs for \( \MW \).
