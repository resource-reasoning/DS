\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusions}
We introduced an interleaving operational semantics for describing the client-observable behaviour of atomic transactions over distributed kv-stores, 
using abstract states comprising global, centralised kv-stores, partial client views, and execution steps parametrised by an execution test
directly capturing when a transaction is able to commit on a state.
We provide a general definition of consistency model, parametrised by an execution test,
and instantiate it for several well known models including  \( \CC, \PSI, \SI \) and \( \SER \).
In \cite{shale-phd} we prove that our definitions are equivalent to the existing definitions in the literature that us execution graphs.

We have used our semantics to verify that protocols of real-world
distributed databases satisfy particular consistency models; \eg that the replicated database COPS \cite{cops} satisfies \( \CC \), and the
partitioned database Clock-SI \cite{clocksi} satisfies \( \SI \). 
These results contrast with the results in the literature, which justify the
correctness of implementations using consistency model definitions that are specific to the implementations. 
We have also proved several invariant properties for clients, 
showing that the clients of several libraries (single-counter, multi-counter and banking libraries) are robust against certain models, 
and showing that the clients of a lock library adhering to a pattern satisfy a mutual exclusion property under \( \PSI \), even though they are not robust against $\PSI$. 
We thus believe that our semantics provides an interesting \emph{mid-point} between distributed
implementations and clients.  We plan to validate further the
usefulness of our semantics by verifying other well-known protocols
of distributed databases \cite{ramp,redblue,eiger,wren}; exploring
robustness results for OLTP workloads such as TPC-C \cite{tpcc} and
RUBiS \cite{rubis}; and exploring other program analysis techniques
such as transaction chopping \cite{psi-chopping,chopping}, invariant
checking \cite{cise,repliss} and program logics \cite{alonetogether}.
We also plan to develop tools to generate litmus tests for implementations and to analyse client programs.


It is common for real-world distributed databases to satisfy the
\emph{snapshot property} and the \emph{last-write-wins} policy. 
Under these assumptions, we do not know of a consistency
model that we cannot express using our semantics. 
There are consistency models that do not satisfy these assumptions, 
\eg\emph{read committed} \cite{ramp} which is captured in \cite{seebelieve}. 
In the future, we will explore whether it is possible to weaken our
assumptions to express such weak consistency models. This might be possible by introducing `promises' 
in the style of \cite{promises}. 


There are many resonances between the high-level  behaviour
of distributed systems and the low-level behaviour  of weak
memory. Indeed, our partial client views were 
inspired by the views of  the `promising' C11 semantics in \cite{promises}. 
In the future, we plan to explore whether our semantics of atomic transactions can be loosened to describe the more fine-grained behaviour of transactions on weak
memory \cite{PSI-RA,SI-RA,DBLP:conf/pldi/ChongSW18}. 
We are also interested in the work of Doherty \etal\citet{op-semantics-c11-rar}, describing an
operational semantics and a program logic for the release-acquire (RA) fragment of C11, which, interestingly, 
is based on dependency graphs. 
We believe that we can adapt our semantics to model the RA fragment, using simple read-write
primitives rather than atomic transactions and a variant of our definition of causal consistency.%, and would like contrast their approach with ours.
