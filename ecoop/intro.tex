\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Transactions are the \emph{de facto} synchronisation mechanism in
modern distributed databases. To achieve scalability and performance,
distributed databases often use weak transactional consistency
guarantees known as \emph{consistency models}.  Many consistency
models were originally invented by engineers using (some quite
informal) definitions specific to particular real-world reference
implementations
\cite{gdur,ramp,CORFU,tango,si,distrsi,clocksi,redblue,rola,cops,PSI-RA,NMSI,PSI,wren}.
More recently, unified definitions of consistency models have been
defined independently of particular implementations, either
declaratively using execution graphs \cite{adya,ev_transactions} or
operationally using state-based semantics or graph-based \cite{seebelieve,alonetogether,sureshConcur}.

A key challenge is to define a unified semantics for consistency
models which provides a \emph{mid-point}, an abtract interface, with which to 
verify distributed implementations \emph{and} analyse the
behaviour of client programs with respect to a particular consistency model. Current
work tends to be suitable  either for verifying implementations or for reasoning
about clients. As far as we are aware, there has been no
previous work on distributed transactions that does both. 
We introduce an operational semantics for directly describing the
client-observable behaviour of atomic transactions 
updating distributed key-value stores (kv-stores).
With our semantics, we can verify distributed implementations and prove
invariant properties of client programs.  

The declarative approach for defining 
consistency models using execution graphs has been substantially
studied \cite{adya,ev_transactions,framework-concur,SIanalysis,laws}. 
In such graphs,  nodes are atomic transactions and edges describe the
known dependencies between transactions.
They capture different consistency models using  a two-step procedure:
\begin{enumerate*}
\item construct \emph{candidate executions} of the whole program comprising
transactions in which reads may contain arbitrary values; and 
\item apply a number of \emph{axioms} on such executions to rule out invalid executions. 
Such axioms may state, for example, that every read is
validated by a write that has written the read value. 
\end{enumerate*}
The most well-known execution graphs are dependency graphs \cite{adya} and abstract
executions \cite{ev_transactions,framework-concur}. 
Dependency graphs tend to be used to analyse  client programs: for
example, 
Fekete et al. \citet{fekete-tods} derived 
a static analysis checker for a particular weak consistency model called
snapshot isolation;  Bernardi and Gotsman \citet{giovanni_concur16}
developed a static analysis checker for several weak consistency
models assuming the so-called snapshot property\footnote{The \emph{snapshot property}, 
also known as \emph{atomic visibility}, states that
the client observes that a transaction reads from an atomic snapshot
of the database and commits atomically;  intermediate states are not observable to other clients, 
even if the underlying distributed protocol has a more fine-grained behaviour.}; and 
Beillahi et al. \citep{snapshot-isolation-robust-tool} developed a tool based on Lipton's reduction \cite{Lipton-reduction}
for checking robustness properties against snapshot isolation: 
that is, a  particular program (or set of programs) behaves as if the consistency model is strong consistency. 
Abstract executions, on the other hand, tend to be used to verify  implementation protocols: for example,
abstract executions are the  standard by which many system engineers
demonstrate that their protocols satisfies  certain
consistency models \cite{cops,NMSI,PSI}. 
Execution graphs provide little information about how the 
state evolves throughout the execution of a program.
They are therefore unsuitable for invariant-based program analysis 
which requires reasoning about the step-wise execution of a program. 


The operational approach for defining consistency models has been much less studied. 
Crooks {\em et
  al.}~\citet{seebelieve} provided a \emph{state-based} trace
semantics over a global centralised store, where an execution step
involves analysing the totally-ordered history of states and the
read-write set of the transaction.
Nagar and Jagannathan \citet{sureshConcur} introduced an
compositional operational semantics for abstract execution graphs, 
where each
step involves adding the next transaction node by: \begin{enumerate*}
\item constructing \emph{candidate executions};  and 
\item ruling out executions using {axioms}. 
\end{enumerate*}
%They capture a wide range of
%consistency model, and demonstrate the equivalence of several
%mplementation-specific definitions.  However, their approach does not
%lend itself to analysing client programs, since observations made by
%clients require the total order in which transactions commit which the
%clients do not have.
Kaki et al. \citet{alonetogether} proposed an
operational semantics for SQL transaction programs over an abstract
centralised store, focussing on consistency models given by the standard
ANSI/SQL isolation levels \cite{si} such as snapshot isolation but not
weaker consistency models such as parallel snapshot isolation.

%interleaving of primitive operations.  This results in an unnecessary
%explosion of the space of traces obtained by the program.  This

%Finally, it is worth mentioning that
%Koskinen and Parkinson \citet{push-pull}  provided a \emph{log-based}
%abstract operational semantics for verifying several implementations
%of serilisability but does not provide unified semantics for
%defining weaker consistency models.
All approaches have their merits. None of them provide a direct
state-based operational semantics for weak consistency models. We give
a detailed comparison with our work in the next subsection.


We introduce an interleaving operational semantics for
describing the client-observable behaviour of atomic transactions on
distributed key-value stores (\cref{sec:model}). Our semantics is
based on a notion of abstract state which 
comprises a \emph{centralised key-value store} (kv-store) with
\emph{multi-versioning}, which is {global} in the sense that it
records all the versions of a key, and
\emph{client views}, which are {partial} in the sense that  clients see only a subset of the
versions. Our client views are partly inspired by the views in the specific C11
operational semantics in~\cite{promises}. An execution step depends
simply on the abstract state, the read-write set of the atomic transaction, and an \emph{execution test} which
determines if a client with a given view is allowed to do the
transaction commit. Different execution tests give rise to different consistency models, 
which we show to be equivalent to well-known
declarative definitions of consistency model on abstract executions 
(reported here and proved in \cite{shale-phd}) and hence dependency graphs~\cite{laws}. 
Our execution tests are analogous to the commit tests used in \cite{seebelieve},
except that they require an analysis of the whole trace whereas we require the current abstract state. 

We make the assumption that our transactions satisfy the \emph{snapshot property}.
This assumption is common  in distributed databases: for example, with
on-line shopping application, a client only sees one snapshot of the database and
only has knowledge that their transaction has successfully committed.
We also make the assumption that our transactions satisfy the \emph{last-write-wins} resolution policy,
a widely-used policy in many real-world distributed kv-stores. 
This means that when a transaction observes several updates to a key,
the atomic snapshot contains the value written by the last update.
Our execution tests  uniformly capture  many well-known consistency
models (\cref{sec:cm}) including 
\emph{causal consistency} \((\CC)\) \citep{ev_transactions,cops,causal-def}, 
\emph{parallel snapshot isolation} \( (\PSI) \) \citep{NMSI,PSI},
\emph{snapshot isolation} \((\SI)\) \citep{si} 
and \emph{serialisability} \((\SER)\) \citep{Papadimitriou-ser}.
%Given these assumptions, we do not know of a consistency model that we cannot represent. 

Using our operational semantics, we demonstrate that we can verify
that database protocols satisfy particular consistency models and
prove invariant properties of client programs with respect to such
consistency models (\cref{sec:applications}).
We establish the correctness of two database
protocols: the COPS protocol for  fully replicated kv-stores \cite{cops} 
which satisfies causal consistency (reported in \cref{sec:verify-impl}
and detail in \cite{shale-phd}); 
and the Clock-SI protocol for partitioned kv-stores \cite{clocksi} 
which satisfies snapshot isolation (given in \cite{shale-phd}). 
We prove invariant properties of client programs calling
transactional libraries (\cref{sec:invariant-client-programs}): the robustness of the single-counter library
against PSI;  the robustness of the multi-counter library and the
well-known banking library \cite{bank-example-wsi} against SI; and the
correctness of a program pattern using locks against PSI. 
We believe our robustness results are the first to take into account client
sessions: with sessions, we show that multiple counters {\em are not} robust against \(\PSI\);
interestingly, without sessions, \citet{giovanni_concur16} show that multiple counters \emph{are}
robust against \(\PSI\) using static-analysis techniques which are
known not to be applicable to sessions.  
These results indicate that  our operational semantics provides an interesting \emph{mid-point},
that is, an abtract interface,
between distributed databases and clients.
This was an important goal for us, resonating with recent work
that does just this for standard shared-memory concurrency \cite{tada,cap,iris,fcsl}. 



\subsection{Related Work} 
\label{sec:newrelated}

Operational semantics for defining weak consistency models for
distributed atomic transactions has hardly been
studied. As far as we are aware, the key papers are~\cite{seebelieve,sureshConcur,alonetogether}. These papers
assume the last-write-wins policy, as does this paper. In addition,
\cite{sureshConcur} and this paper assume the snapshot property, a
common assumption for distributed databases. In contrast,
\cite{seebelieve} and~\cite{ alonetogether} do not assume the
snapshot property, because the focus is on ANSI/SQL isolation levels.



%We first describe this work in
%some detail, and then briefly mention additional work.



Crooks et al. \citet{seebelieve} have proposed a state-based trace
semantics for describing weak consistency models that employs concepts
similar to our views and execution tests, called read states and
commit tests respectively.  In their semantics, a one-step trace
reduction is determined by the whole previous history of the trace.
In contrast, our reduction step only depends on the current kv-store
and view.  They capture more consistency models than us, such as {\em
  read committed}, due to their focus on isolation levels which do not
have the snapshot property. They use their semantics to 
demonstrate that 
several definitions of snapshot isolation  given in the
literature~\cite{citations} in fact collapse into one.  They do not verify
protocol implementations and do not prove invariant properties of
client programs.  We believe~\cite{seebelieve} can be used to verify
implementations. We believe it is difficult to use~\cite{seebelieve}
to prove invariant properties of client programs.  Their notion of
trace includes a large amount of information (for example, the total
order on transactions) that just would not be observable by a
client (for example, a client on one replica does not necessarily see
a transaction on another replica).
In contrast, our  approach focusses on the client-observable history
which is not total.
We demonstrate  that we can 
prove invariant properties of
client programs in \cref{sec:robustness}. 



Nagar and Jagannathan \cite{sureshConcur} have proposed a fine-grained operational semantics on abstract exactions 
and developed a model-checking tool for the violation of robustness. 
They do this by converting abstract executions to
dependency graphs and checking the violation of robustness on the
dependency graphs. This approach has two issues. First, despite 
assuming atomic visibility of transactions, they present a fine-grained
semantics at the level of the individual transactional operations
rather than whole transactions, introducing unnecessary interleavings
which complicates the client reasoning and increases  the
search space of model-checking tools. 
In contrast, our semantics is coarse-grained in that interleaving is at the level of whole
transactions. 
Second, all the literature that performs client analysis
on abstract executions achieves this indirectly by over-approximating
the consistency-model specifications using dependency graphs
\cite{giovanni_concur16,SIanalysis,psi-chopping,laws,sureshConcur}. 
It is  unknown how to do this precisely \cite{laws}. 
In contrast, we prove robustness results directly by
analysing the structure of kv-stores, without over-approximation. 
We also give precise reasoning about the mutual exclusion of locks,
which we believe will be difficult to prove using abstract executions.


Kaki et al. \citet{alonetogether} have proposed an operational
semantics for SQL transaction programs over an abstract centralised
single-version 
store, with consistency models given by the standard ANSI/SQL
isolation levels \cite{si}. They develop a program logic and prototype
tool for reasoning about client programs, and so can capture invariant
properties of the state. They can express snapshot isolation, but the consensus is that they cannot capture the weaker
consistency models such as parallel snapshot isolation \cite{PSI}
which is an important consistency model for distributed databases.




Finally,  Koskinen and Parkinson
\citet{push-pull} have proposed a log-based semantics for verifying
implementations that satisfy serialisability, based not only on
kv-stores but also on other ADTs. Their work comprises a centralised
global log and partial client local logs, which is a little similar to
our kv-stores and views. Their model focusses on serialisability.
There is no evidence thatit can be easily extended to tackle
weaker consistency models.
