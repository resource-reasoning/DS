A multi-counter library on a set of keys \( \keyset \) is defined by
\( \pcounters*(\keyset) \FuncDef \bigcup_{\key \in \keyset } \pcounter*(\key) \).
As discussed in \cref{sec:overview}, the multi-counter library is not robust against \(\PSI\). 
We next show that this library is \( \WSI \)-safe,
and therefore robust against \( \WSI \) and all stronger models such as \( \SI \).

\begin{theorem}[Robustness of multi-counter against \(\WSI \)]
  For a set of keys \( \keyset \),
  the multi-counter library \( \pcounters*(\keyset) \) is robust against \( \WSI \).
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
It is sufficient to show that any kv-store obtained by
executing a program \( \prog_0 \) of the multi-counter library is \( \WSI \)-safe.
Let \( \confinit = (\kvsinit, \vienvinit) \) be an initial configuration
such that \( \Dom(\prog_0) \subseteq \Dom(\vienvinit) \),
and \( \clenv \) be a client environment such that \( \Dom(\prog_0) \subseteq \Dom(\vienv) \).
We proceed by induction on the length of traces \( \progtrc \).
\begin{enumerate}
\Case{\( \progtrc = \ToProg{\kvsinit | \vienvinit | \clenv | \prog_0 } \)}
    The initial configuration trivially satisfies 
    \cref{equ:wsi-safe-read-only,equ:wsi-safe-write-must-read,equ:wsi-safe-all-write}.
\Case{\( \progtrc = \ToProg{\progtrc' | \lb -> \kvs | \vienv | \clenv | \prog } \)}
    If the next step \( \lb \) is a local computation,
    then by the \ih, \( \kvs\) must be \( \WSI \)-safe.
    Let \( (\kvs',\vienv',\clenv',\prog')  = \LastConf(\progtrc') \) be the last configuration.
    Consider that \( \lb \) is a transaction.
    \begin{enumerate}
    \Case{\(\lb\) from \( \pread*(\var,\key) \)}
        The label \( \lb \) must be \( \lb = \lbTrans{\vi,\fp} \)
        for some \( \cl \), view \( \vi \) and fingerprint \( \fp \)  such that
        \(\fp = \Set{\opR(\key,\val) } \).
        The resulting kv-store is given by the following:
        \[ 
            \kvs = \kvs'\UpdateFunc{\key -> \kvs'(\key)\UpdateFunc{\idx -> (\val, \txid', \txidset \uplus \Set{\txid})}} 
        \]
        for \( \idx = \Max(\vi(\key)) \) and \( \kvs'(\key,\idx) = (\val,\txid',\txidset)\).
        By the \ih, in the new kv-store \( \kvs \),
        transactions that already exists in \( \kvs' \) 
        satisfy \cref{equ:wsi-safe-read-only,equ:wsi-safe-write-must-read,equ:wsi-safe-all-write}.
        Since the new transaction \( \txid \) is a read-only transaction,
        it trivially satisfies \cref{equ:wsi-safe-read-only,equ:wsi-safe-write-must-read,equ:wsi-safe-all-write} in \( \kvs \).
    \Case{\(\lb\) from \( \pinc*(\var,\key) \)}
        The label \( \lb \) must be \( \lb = \lbTrans{\vi,\fp} \)
        for some \( \cl \), view \( \vi \) and fingerprint \( \fp \)  such that
        \(\fp = \Set{\opR(\key,\val), \opW(\key,\val') } \).
        Since transaction \( \txid \) writes to key \( \key \),
        the view for the key must included all versions associated with the key,
        that is, \( \vi(\key) = \Set{n | 0 \leq n < \Abs{\kvs'(\key)} } \).
        Then the resulting kv-store \( \kvs\) is: 
        \[
            \kvs = \kvs'\UpdateFunc{\key -> \left( \left( \kvs'(\key)\UpdateFunc{ 
                    \idx -> (\val, \txid', \txidset \uplus \Set{\txid})}  \right)
                            \ListConcat \List{(\val', \txid, \emptyset)} \right) } 
        \]
        where \( \idx = \Abs{\kvs'(\key)} - 1\) and \( \kvs'(\key,\idx) = (\val,\txid',\txidset)\).
        As \( \txid_{i+1} \) reads the latest version of \( \key \) and writes a new version to \( \key \) and the \ih,
        the new kv-store \( \kvs \) satisfies 
        \cref{equ:wsi-safe-read-only,equ:wsi-safe-write-must-read,equ:wsi-safe-all-write}. \qedhere
