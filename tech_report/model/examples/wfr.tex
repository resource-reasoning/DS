\emph{Write follow read} (\(\WFR \)) \citep{session-guarantee,repldatatypes} model states that, prior to committing a transaction, 
if a client \(\cl\) sees a version on a key \(\key\) written by some client \(\cl'\) (possibly equal to \(\cl\)), 
then it must also see the versions of the same key \(\key\) previously read by \(\cl'\). 
This condition is modelled by the predicate \( \PreClosed(\kvs,\vi,\rel[\WFR]) \)
with \( \rel[\WFR] = \WR[\kvs] ; \Refl((\SO \cap \RW[\kvs]))\).
Note that if \( \ToEdge{\txid | \WR[\kvs] -> \txid' | \Refl((\SO \cap \RW[\kvs])) -> \txid'' } \),
then:
\begin{enumerate*}
\item transactions \( \txid',\txid'' \) are from the same client;
\item \( \txid' \) read a version of some \( \key \) written by \( \txid \);
and later \( \txid'' \) writes a newer version of the same key \( \key \).
\end{enumerate*}
The kv-store in \cref{fig:wfr-disallowed} is disallowed by \(\WFR\),
since transaction \(\txid\) read the third version of key \( \key_2 \) written by \(\cl\),
who previous read the second version of key \(\key_2 \) written by \( \txid' \),
however, transaction \(\txid\) did not read the second version of \( \key_1 \) also written by \( \txid' \).
Recall that a view satisfies snapshot property.
