\emph{Monotonic read} (\( \MR \)) \citep{session-guarantee,repldatatypes} states that after committing a transaction, 
a client cannot lose information in that 
it can only see increasingly more versions from a kv-store.
This prevents, for example, the kv-store in \cref{fig:mr-disallowed},
since client \(\cl\) first reads the latest version of \(\key\) in \(\txid_{\cl}^{1}\), 
and then reads the older, initial version of \(\key\) in \(\txid_{\cl}^{2}\).  
As such, the \(\ViewShift[\MR]\) predicate in \cref{fig:execution-tests} 
ensures that clients can only extend their views,
that is, \( \vi \vileq \vi' \) for views \( \vi, \vi'\) before and after committing.
When this is the case, clients can then \emph{always} commit their transactions,
and thus \(\CanCommit[\MR]\) is simply defined as \(\true\).
