\section{Specifications for Consistency models}
\label{sec:execution-tests}
\label{sec:execution.tests}
\label{sec:spec}

In this section we model how key-value stores evolve when a client commits 
the effects of a transaction.
Because we want to model different consistency models, 
this notion is parametrised by an \emph{execution test}, which determine whether 
a client may commit the effects of a transaction to the kv-store, at a given time.
