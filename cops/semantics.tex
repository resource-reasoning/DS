\subsection{semantics}
Let \( \repl \in \Repls \) denotes the set of totally ordered replicates.
Each replicate can have multiple clients, and 
each clients can commit a sequence of either read-only transitions or single-write transactions.
To model these, we annotate the transaction identifier with replicate \( \repl \), client \( \cl \), 
local time of the replicate \( n \) and read-only transactions count\ ( n' \), \ie \( \txidCOPS{\repl}{\cl}{n}{n'} \)
We extend version with the set of all versions it dependencies on, \( \dep \in \pset{\Keys \times \TxID} \).
The function \( \depOf{\ver} \) denotes the dependencies set of the version.

We give the following semantics to capture the behaviours of the code.
