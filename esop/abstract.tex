We introduce an interleaving operational semantics for describing the
client-observable behaviour of atomic transactions on distributed
key-value stores. Our semantics builds on abstract states comprising
centralised, global key-value stores and partial client views. 
We provide
operational definitions of consistency models for our abstract states  which
we show to be equivalent to the well-known declarative definitions
of consistency model for execution graphs. We explore  two
applications,  verifying  that the COPS 
geo-replicated database
and the  Clock-SI  partitioned database  satisfy their 
consistency
models using trace refinement,  % embedding them in our centralised
                               % semantics; 
and proving  invariant properties of client programs.
