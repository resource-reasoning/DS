\section{Operational Semantics on KV-Stores}
\label{sec:full-semantics}

\begin{definition}[Multi-version Key-value Stores]
\label{def:mkvs-appendix}
Assume a countably infinite set of \emph{keys} $\Keys \ni \key$, 
and a countably infinite set of  \emph{values} $\Val \ni \val$, 
including an \emph{initialisation value} $\val_0 $.
The set of \emph{versions}, $\Versions \ni \ver$, is: $\Versions \defeq \Val \times \TxID \times \pset{\TxID_{0}}$. 
A \emph{kv-store} is a function $\mkvs: \Keys \to \func{List}[\Versions]$, 
where $\func{List}[\Versions] \ni \vilist$ is the set of lists of versions $\Versions$. 
Well-formed key-values store satisfy:
\begin{align}
& \fora{\key, i, j} 
\rsOf(\mkvs(\key, i)) \cap \rsOf(\mkvs(\key, j)) \neq \emptyset \lor
\wtOf(\mkvs(\key, i)) = \wtOf(\mkvs(\key, j))
\implies i = j  \\
& \fora{\key} \mkvs(\key, 0) = (\val_0, \txid_0, \stub) \\
& \fora{ \key, \cl, i,j, n, m} 
\txid_{\cl}^{n} = \wtOf(\mkvs(\key,i)) \land \txid_{\cl}^{m} \in
\Set{\wtOf(\mkvs(\key,j))} \cup \rsOf(\mkvs(\key, i)) \implies n < m
\end{align}
\end{definition}

The full semantics is in \cref{def:program_semantics} and the full definition of consistency models is in  \cref{fig:app-execution-tests}.

\begin{definition}[ET-reduction]
An \emph{\(\ET\)-reduction}, \((\mkvs, \vienv) \toET{(\cl, \alpha)} (\mkvs', \vienv')\), is defined by:
%we define the \(\ET\)-trace as a sequence of \(\ET\)-reductions on configurations that a client
\begin{enumerate}
    \item either \(\alpha = \varepsilon\), \(\mkvs' = \mkvs\) and $\vienv' =
      \vienv\rmto{\cl}{\vi}\) for some \(u\) such that \( \vienv(\cl) \sqsubseteq u\); or
\item \(\alpha = \fp\) for some \(\fp\), and \(\ET \vdash (\mkvs, \vi ) \csat \fp : (\mkvs', \vi')\), where \(\mkvs' = \updateKV[\mkvs, \vi, \fp, \txid]\) 
   for some \(\txid \in \nextTxid(\cl, \mkvs)\), \(\vienv' = \vienv\rmto{\cl}{\vi'}\).
\end{enumerate}
A finite sequence of \(\ET\)-reductions starting in an
initial configuration \(\conf_{0}\) is called  an \emph{\(\ET\)-trace}. 
\end{definition}
Each \(\ET\)-trace  starting with an initial configuration
(\cref{def:configuration}) terminates in a configuration \((\mkvs, \stub)\) where \(\mkvs\) is obtained as a result of several clients committing transactions under the 
execution test \(\ET\). The consistency model induced by \(\ET\), 
written \(\CMs(\ET)\), is the set of all such terminal kv-stores.

Note that in the definition of \(\ET\)-traces, the view-shifts and 
transaction commits are decoupled. This is in contrast to the
operational semantics (\cref{sec:model}, \cref{fig:semantics-commands}), 
where view-shifts and transaction commits are combined in a single transition of programs (\rl{CAtomicTrans}). 
The reason for this mismatch is best understood when looking at the
intended applications. 
ET-traces are useful for 
proving that a distributed transactional 
protocol implements a given consistency model: in this case, it is convenient to separate shifting a view from committing a transaction, 
as these two steps often take place separately in distributed
protocols. The operational semantics  is particularly useful for  reasoning about transactional 
programs: in this case, the treatment of the view-shifts and transaction commits as a single transition reduces the number of interleavings in programs.
The \(\ET\)-traces and operational semantics are equally expressive as
the following theorem states. 

\begin{theorem}
	\label{thm:ettraces2sem}
	Let \(\interpr{\prog}_{\ET}\) be the set of kv-stores reachable by executing \(\prog\) under the execution test \(\ET\) and  \( \interpr{\et} \) be the the set of kv-stores reachable by \( \et \)-tarces.
    Then for all \(\ET\), \(\interpr{\et} = \bigcup_{\prog} \interpr{\prog}_{\ET}\).
\end{theorem}
