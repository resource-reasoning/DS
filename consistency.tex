\section{Consistency Guarantees}
\label{sec:cm}
Traditional concistency guarantees for distributed databases capture
what it means for distributed data to be consistent. They have been
formally described by axiomatic conditions associated with 
 dependency graphs~\cite{.} and abstract
execution graphs~\cite{.}. We provide consistency guarantees for our
centralised kv-stores by defining a {\em consistency model}, which is
a set of kv-stores representing the possible outcomes that can be
obtained as the result of multiple clients committing several
transactions each.  The set of such transactions of the client are  restricted
to those whose effects comply with the consistency guarantee of the model. To
achieve this, we define consistency models induced by an {\em
  execution test}, which is a relation which determines whether a
client may commit a transaction into a kv-store.  We demontrate in
Section~\ref{.} that our consistency models for kv-stores correspond
to the traditional consistency guarantees for distributed databases,
with different execution tests corresponding to different graph
axioms.




An execution test, formally a set $\ET$ of quadruples of the form $(\mkvs, \vi, \opset, \vi')$,
determines when a client with view $\vi$ on kv-store $\hh$ 
is allowed to commit an atomic  transaction with fingerprint
$\opset$  and obtain an updated view $\vi'$. 


\begin{definition}
\label{def:execution.test}
An \emph{execution test} is a set of tuples $\ET \subseteq \HisHeaps \times \Views \times \powerset{\Ops} \times \Views$ 
such that for all $(\hh, \vi, \opset, \vi') \in \ET$:
\begin{align}
    & 
    \begin{array}{@{}l@{}}
    \fora{\otR, \ke, \val} (\otR, \ke, \val) \in \opset \\
    \quad {} \implies 
    \hh(\ke, \max{}_{<}(\vi(\ke))) = \val  
    \end{array}
    \tag{Ext} \label{eq:read-external} \\
    & 
    \begin{array}{@{}l@{}}
    \fora{\ke} \vi(\ke) \neq \vi'(\ke) \\
    \quad {} \implies
    ( (\otR, \ke, \_) \in \opset \vee (\otW, \ke, \_)) \in \opset) 
    \end{array}
    \tag{ValidViewUpd} \label{eq:valid-view-update}
\end{align}
\end{definition}

\noindent 
The first condition enforces the last-write-wins policy~\cite{}: that
is, a transaction always reads the most recent writes from the initial
view.  The second condition states that a transaction is only allowed
to update the view for those keys that have been recorded in the
fingerprint.  We often write
$\ET \vdash (\hh, \vi) \triangleright \opset: \vi'$ for
$(\mkvs, \vi, \opset, \vi') \in \ET$.

\pg{I am uncomfortable about u' having a potential index to k due to a 
write in F that is not in K, but is in the updated, but  not
mentioned,  store.}

\pg{Just thoughts. I find ValidViewUpd to be very confusing. I understand that if the
  views are different on k then k has to be mentioned in the 
  fingerprint. Apart from this condition, it seems as if anything can happen to the
  view. If fact, what `should' a transaction be able to do. It
  can certainly update the store in two ways: either through reading
  and hence extending a version of  the
  snapshot; or writing at the end of the store. Now what `should'
  happen to the view. At the moment pretty much anything for the ks
mentioned in F. }


\noindent Given an execution set  $\ET$, we define the $\ET$-trace which is a
sequence of $\ET$-reductions on configutations that either moves the
client view to be a more up-to-date view, or commits a fingerprint of
a transaction. 

\begin{definition}[$\ET$-trace]
\label{def:reduction}
An \emph{action} $\alpha \in \Act$ has either the form $(\cl, \varepsilon)$, 
or $(\cl, \opset)$, for client 
$\cl$ and fingerprint $\opset$. 
Given an execution test $\ET$, the $\ET$-\emph{reduction relation},
$\xrightarrowtriangle{}_{\ET} \subseteq \Confs \times \Act \times \Confs$, 
is the smallest relation such that for all $\vi, \vi', \cl, \hh, \hh', \viewFun, \opset$:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item 
    $
    \viewFun(\cl) = \vi 
    \wedge \vi \sqsubseteq \vi' 
    \implies (\hh, \viewFun) \xrightarrowtriangle{(\cl, \varepsilon)}_{\ET} 
    (\hh, \viewFun\rmto{\cl}{\vi'})$; and
	\item 
    $\viewFun(\cl) = \vi
        \wedge ((\mkvs, \vi,
\opset, \vi') \in \ET
        \wedge \hh' \in \updateKV(\hh, \vi, \cl, \opset) \implies
	$  \\
	\phantom{a} \hfill 
	$(\hh, \viewFun) \xrightarrowtriangle{(\cl, \opset)}_{\ET} (\hh', \viewFun\rmto{\cl}{\vi'})$
\end{enumerate}
Given an execution test $\ET$, an \emph{$\ET$-trace} is a sequence of $\ET$-reductions of the form $\conf_{0} \xrightarrowtriangle{\alpha_{0}}_{\ET} \cdots 
\xrightarrow{\alpha_{n-1}} \conf_{n}$.
\end{definition}


\pg{In 2, how do we know that $\hh'$ and $\vi'$ are compatible?}



\noindent A consistency model induced by $\ET$ is a set of kv-stores
that  result from
an $\ET$-trace starting from the 
initial configuration (Definition~\ref{views??}). 

\begin{definition}[Consistency Model]
\label{def:cm}
Given an execution test $\ET$ and initial configuration $\conf_0$ (Definition~\ref{view??}),
the set of configurations $\Confs(\ET) $   induced by $\ET$ is   given by: 
\[
\Confs(\ET)\defeq \Setcon{ \conf_n}{ \exsts{\conf_0} \conf_0 \text{ 
    initial}  \wedge \conf_0 \xrightarrowtriangle{\stub}_{\ET} \cdots
  \xrightarrowtriangle{\stub}_{\ET} \conf_n }
\]
The \emph{consistency model} induced by $\ET$ is:
\( 
\CMs(\ET) \defeq \Setcon{ \hh }{ (\hh, \stub) \in \Confs(\ET) }
\)
\end{definition}
\pg{Above  definition of $\Confs(\ET) $ seems a slightly informal definition. Layout needs attention.}

\noindent In~\cref{sec:mono-et}, we prove that consistency models are 
\emph{monotonic}: 
if  $\ET_1 \subseteq \ET_2$ then $\CMs(\ET_1) \subseteq \CMs(\ET_2)$.
In~\cref{sec:et-comm}, we also prove that  $\CMs(\ET_1 \cap \ET_2) = \CMs(\ET_1) \cap
\CMs(\ET_2)$ under certain conditions on the $\ET_i$.


\pg{Theorem  commented out below must be incorrect. I think you will
  need both  $\ET_1$ and $\ET_2$ commutative.}



%\begin{definition}

\pg{I am using distributed databases to mean replicated or sharded
  databases. This will be made clear, once and for all, in the
  introduction and ever afterwards we just refer to distributed databases.}

We now give examples of execution tests in~\cref{fig:execution.tests},
where the associated consistency models for kv-stores correspond to
widely adopted consistency guaranteees for distributed databases.
Following \cite{distrprinciples}, we distinguish between
client-centric and data-centric consistency models: the former
constrain the client views; and the latter impose conditions on the
structure of the kv-store.  In Figure~\ref{.}, we give illustrative
examples of allowed and disallowed key-value stores for our
consistency models.

\pg{Below is great, got lots of information in short space. There's a bit  of
  imprecision in the English description of the consistency
  models, especially the first sentences. I've tried my best and have
  left the original commented out. I'm sure you can do much
  better. Please will somebody do this properly, unifying language as
  much as possible so that there are not many different phrases that
  say the same thing.}


\noindent {\bf Monotonic Reads ($\MRd$).}
%It ensures that read operations from subsequent transactions always
%return a more up-to-date versions.
It states that a client  can never loose information from the
view, hence the read operations can only read increasingly
more up-to-date versions. This prevents, for example,  the kv-store of \cref{fig:mr-disallowed},
since the client $\cl$ first observes the
latest version of $\ke$ using $\txid_{\cl}^{1}$ and then it observes
the older, initial version of $\ke$ using $\txid_{\cl}^{2}$.  The
execution test $\ET_{\MRd}$ ensures that clients  can only extend
their views. 

\noindent {\bf Monotonic Writes ($\MW$).}
It states that whenever a transaction observes a version installed by some client $\cl$,
then the transaction observes all versions installed by the client $\cl$. This prevents the kv-store of 
\cref{fig:mw-disallowed}, since 
transaction $\txid'$ observes the second version of $\ke_2$, carrying
value $\val_2$ and written by client $\cl$, 
but it does not observe the second version of $\ke_1$, carrying value
$\val_1$ and previously written by the same client.
The execution test $\ET_{\MW}$  ensures that, prior to executing a transaction,
the set of versions included in the view of the client must be write 
prefix-closed with respect to the relation $\PO ?$.

\pg{I've rewritten RYW execution test to use SO?.}

\pg{Below uses $\hh'$, makes me wonder more about whether $(\hh',
  \vi') $ should be the result of the execution test?}

\noindent {\bf Read Your Writes (\RYW).}
It states that a client must always be able to read any version of a
key that was previously written by the same client.
\pg{Is the above imprecise? It could be that the client reads a
  different version of the key as the view has moved forward? I think
  it should be about views.}
This prevents the key-value store of \cref{fig:ryw-disallowed},
since the initial version of $\ke$ carries value $0$
and the client $\cl$ tries to increment the value of $\ke$ by $1$
twice.  For its first transaction, it reads the initial value $0$ and then
installs  a new version carrying  value $1$. For its second
transaction, since the client  need not  read its own writes, 
it might read the initial value $0$ again
and install a new version carrying value $1$.
The execution test $\RYW$ ensures  that, after committing a transaction, 
the  client view includes all the versions it wrote.  

\pg{Below, not well explained at all, I  keep thinking I'm saying
  the same thing again and again.}
\noindent {\bf Write Follows Reads (\WFR).}
%It states that if a client \( \cl \) writes some version $\ver$ in a transaction,
%following  another transaction (or in the same transaction of) who reads of some version $\ver'$, 
%then a transaction may observe version $\ver$ only if it also
%observes $\ver'$. 
It states that, if a transaction observes a version written by a
client, then it must also observe the versions previously read by the
client using  the $\PO?$ relation.
This prevents the kv-store of \cref{fig:wfr-disallowed},
since  a transaction $\txid$ observes a version written by $\cl$ but
not a version  previously read by $\cl$.
% the version $\ver_2$ of $\ke_2$ carrying value $\val_2$ written by client $\cl$,
%but the same transaction $\txid$ does not observe the version of $\ke_1$ carrying value $\val_1$, read by $\cl$ prior to writing $\%ver$. 
The execution test $\ET_{\WFR}$  ensures
that a view includes all the versions previously read by a client 
if the view already includes a write from that client. 

\noindent {\bf Causal Consistency (\CC).}
Causal Consistency requires that if a client observes a version $\ver$, 
then it must also observe any version from which $\ver$ potentially depends \cite{cops}. 
The dependency here means $\PO?$  and $    \RF_{\hh}$, defined  in
figure~\ref{.}. For $\PO?$, it means that, when a view includes some effect from a client, 
it must include the previous effects  from the same client.

\pg{Above sentence, I don't know what to write here as I don't understand what it is
  saying.  For $    \RF_{\hh}$, it means when a view includes a transaction (the versions it write),
it must include all the writes that the transaction read from.}

A necessary and sufficient condition is to enforce the four session
guarantees $\MRd, \MW, \RYW$ and $\WFR$ \cite{session2causal}:
$\ET_{\CC} = \ET_{\MRd} \cap \ET_{\MW} \cap \ET_{\RYW} \cap
\ET_{\WFR}$.

\pg{Above, we should mention that in Section~\ref{.} we show that the
  COPS implementation is CC.}

\noindent {\bf Update Atomic ($\UA$).}
This consistency model has been proposed in \cite{framework-concur}, 
though we are not aware of any implementation that directly works with
this consistency guarantee. 
However, many implemented consistency models can be obtained by
strengthening Update Atomic.
It disallows concurrent transactions writing to the same key,
a property is known as \emph{write conflict detection}.
This prevents the kv-store of \cref{fig:ua-disallowed},
sicne two transactions $\txid, \txid'$ concurrently increment the initial version of $\ke$ by $1$.
Not that $\UA$ generalises $\RYW$, 
since we do not require $\txid, \txid'$ to be executed by the same client.
The execution test $\ET_\UA$  ensures that 
a client $\cl$ can write to a key 
only if its view includes the last version of
the key. 

\pg{Above, this last sentence seems imprecise as the view includes all
  versions of the key. }

\noindent {\bf Parallel Snapshot Isolation (\PSI).} 
It combines  causal consistency and update atomic:
$\ET_{\PSI} = \ET_{\CC} \cap \ET_{\UA}$.
%, and $\ET_{\SI} = \ET_{\CC}\cap \ET_{\UA}$.

\pg{Above, you should mention that you show that Clock.SI satisfies
  PSI (if it does or SI below, can't remember).}

\pg{Now I've totally lost it. I'm making comments to try to help you
  explain it better.}




\noindent {\bf Consistent Prefix ($\CP$).}
\label{para:cp}
In centralised databases, where there is a total order in which transactions commit, 
$\CP$ is described by the following property: 
if a client observes the effect of a transaction $\txid$,
then it also observe the effect of any transaction that commits before
$\txid$.

\pg{Above, I am confused by this sentence. In particular, with SI we
  have WW; RW, which is a write that's definitely happened before $t$.
I understand the difference between CP and SI from looking at the
relations, not from reading the English.}



\pg{Below, I don't understand this example, it does not fit with the
  figure. The figure example is also an example os something that
  doesn't fit RYW, so it is not great. I would have thought an example
  using SO; RW would have been good.}
Intuitively, the \( \CP \) disallows that a transaction observes updates in different order (\cref{fig:cp-disallowed-1}).
In \cref{fig:cp-disallowed-1}, transactions $\txid_{3}$ and \( \txid_4 \) observes updates in different order.
That is, \( \txid_3 \) observes that the update of $\ke_2$ carrying value $\val_2$ happens before the update of $\ke_1$ carrying value $\val_2$,
yet $\txid_{4}$ observes that the update of $\ke_1$ carrying value
$\val_1$ happens before the update of $\ke_2$ carrying value
$\val_2$. 

\pg{Below, first sentence, comment earlier when you first define kv-store that this
  information is missing.}

\pg{Below paragraph, I have had a go at rewriting the explanation. I have left 
the previous explanation after that, I believe that mine is
better.  I do believe I am not quite accurate and we have to be really
careful to write the English to explain the different between CP and SI.}

\pg{I believe $\RF_{\hh} ; \AD_{\hh} \subseteq \VO_{\hh}$ so I have
  not used it below as it does not add extra writes.}

Inspired by work connecting dependency graphs and abstract execution~\cite{..}, we can formulate the CP property using kv-stores, despite not having
full information about the total order in which transactions commit.
Given key $k$ and transaction $t$ that writes to index $i$, the task
is to identify the writes that occured before $t$. The relations
$\RF_{\hh}$, $\VO_{\hh}$ and $\AD_{\hh} $ in Figure~\ref{.} and the
relation $\PO$ defined in Section~\ref{.}  can be used to identify
the direct writes that have occured before $t$. The interesting
case is the use of the $\AD_{\hh}$ relation: by itself, this relation
only identifies reads happening before writes; however, used in the
relations $\PO ;
\AD_{\hh}$, it identifies further  writes happening
before $t$. The $\dagger$ relation
\[
\WTx(\hh(\ke', j)) \toEdge{((\PO ; \AD_{\hh}? )\cup \RF_{\hh} \cup \VO_{\hh})^{+}} t
\]
identifies all the writes that occur before $t$, where $+$ is the
transitive closure. 
The execution test $\ET_{\CP}$ ensures that the initial view is 
closed with respect to this $\ddagger$  relation, and the updated view 
increases ($ \ET_\MRd $) and 
includes the writes associated with the fingerprint using the
session order ($\ET_\RYW $).

\pg{Above, presumably, with Section 5 you have proved somewhere that \[
\WTx(\hh(\ke', j)) \toEdge{((\PO ; \AD_{\hh}? )\cup \RF_{\hh} \cup \VO_{\hh})^{+}} t
\]
identifies all the writes that occur before $t$? Can you reference
this? All we know from here is that the writes happen before $t$, we
do not know that we have all of them.

We coupld perhaps justify transitivity and $\ET_{\CP}$ more. }


\pg{Do we know that the CM relation commutes with union and ;? I
  presume so and   we should say so in previous section. }

\pg{Below are my old comments when I had lost it.  I like above much
  better than below because it's explained in terms of kv-stores
  alone. Here we are justifying kv-stores, next section we are linking
  to dependency graphs and abstract execution.}

Inspired by dependency graph \cite{.....},
there are minimum observable transactions for each transaction derived from the following:
\[
    \SO  \subseteq  \VIS \qquad
    ( ( ( \SO \cup \WR ) ; \RW? )^* \cup \WW ) ; \VIS \subseteq \VIS
\]

%define earlier so not explained here, get rid of all but essential
%detail as difficult enough, people do not need to be reminded what
%composition is
%where the \( R? \) is the reflexive closure of the relation \( R \) 
%and \( R_1 ; R_2 \defeq \Setcon{(a,b)}{\exsts{c} (a,c) \in R_1 \land
%(c,b) \in R_2 } \) is the composition of the two relation.
\pg{What are the minimum observable transitions?}
Given the minimum observable transactions, we can specify $\CP$. 
\pg{Next sentence, the  English and formal relation $
  \ET_\RYW $ do not match.}
First, \( \SO \subseteq \VIS \) means a transaction observes all previous transactions from the same client,
and it is enforced by \( \ET_\RYW \).
\pg{At this point, I previously gave up.}
Then the combination of \( \ddagger\) (\cref{fig:execution-tests}) and \( \ET_\MRd \) gives us \( ( ( ( \SO \cup \WR ) ; \RW? )^* \cup \WW ) ; \VIS \subseteq \VIS \).
Let consider a client \( \cl \) and the view \( \vi \).
Assume two transactions \( \txid, \txid' \)  such that \( \txid' \) is in the view \( \vi \) and \( \txid \toEdge{( ( ( \SO \cup \WR ) ; \RW? )^* \cup \WW )} \txid' \).
If \( \txid' \) is a transaction already observable by some previous transaction from the client \( \cl \), 
the transaction \( \txid \) must be observable by that time,
therefore by the \( \ET_\MRd \), the transaction \( \txid \) is in the current view \( \vi \).
Otherwise, if \( \txid' \) is a transaction that is first time observed by the client \( \cl \),
the \( \dagger \) predicate enforces \( \txid \) is also in the view
\( \vi \).



\noindent {\bf Snapshot Isolation (\SI).}
When the total order in which transactions commit is known,
then $\SI = \CP \cap \UA$~\cite{gsi,framework-concur}. 
This equality does not hold using kv-stores, since transactions are not totally
ordered. For example, the kv-store of \cref{fig:si-disallowed} is included in both $\CMs(\ET_{\CP})$ and $\CMs(\ET_{\UA})$, 
but is forbidden by snapshot isolation in general.
As briefly mentioned  after Definition~\ref{4.3} and proved in~\cref{sec:et-comp},  the equality \( \CMs(\ET_1
\cap \ET_2) = \CMs(\ET_1) \cap \CMs(\ET_2) \) only holds 
under certain conditions on the \( \ET_1 \) and \( \ET_2 \)\footnote{%
    This issue also arises with dependency graphs~\cite{.}, see  Section~\ref{5}.
} .


Again inspired by~\cite{.}, we can formulate the  $\SI $ property
without having full knowledge of the total order on transactions.
The additional component in the $\dagger$ relation for $\SI$, compared
with the $\ddagger$ relation of $\CP$, is the use of the relation
$\VO_{\hh}; \AD_{\hh} $....
\pg{And now I don't know what to say, because this clearly gives more
  writes than CP before $t$, so I've got the English of CP wrong. This
  needs to be subtly explained.}
The execution test $\ET_{\CP}$ ensures that the initial view is 
closed with respect to this $\dagger$  relation and 
sees all the whole history of keys associated with the fingerprint
($\ET_{\UA}$, and the updated view 
increases ($ \ET_\MRd $) and 
includes the writes associated with the fingerprint using the
session order ($\ET_\RYW $).


\pg{Below, I had previously given  up. I think the above style is
  better. Now definitely out of time.}
We are inspired by the following constraint that has been proven satisfying \( \SI \) \cite{cerone:snapshot}:
\[
    (\SO \cup \WW) \subseteq \VIS \quad  ( (\SO \cup \WW \cup \WR) ; \RW? ) ; \VIS \subseteq \VIS
\]
where write-write relation \( (\txid, \txid') \in \WW \) means the transaction \( \txid \) installs a version for a key \( \ke \) following by \( \txid' \) installing a new version for the key \( \ke \).
The constraint \( \SO \subseteq \VIS \) coincides with \( \ET_\RYW \).
The \( \WW \subseteq \VIS \) means two transactions cannot concurrently write to the same key,
which is enforced by \( \ET_\UA \).
Let consider \( ( (\SO \cup \WW \cup \WR) ; \RW? ) ; \VIS \subseteq \VIS \).
Similar to the argument we made in Consistent Prefix (\pageref{para:cp}), 
let assume a client \( \cl \), its view \( \vi \) and two transactions \( \txid, \txid' \) such that 
\( \txid' \) is in the view \( \vi \)
and \( \txid \toEdge{(\SO \cup \WW \cup \WR) ; \RW?} \txid' \).
If \( \txid' \) is observable by any previous transaction of the client \( \cl \),
then \( \txid \) is also observable before.
By \( \ET_\MRd\), it is the case \( \txid \) is in the view \( \vi \).
If \( \txid' \) is a new transaction observed by the client \( \cl \),
the \( \dagger \) enforces that \( \txid \) should be included \( \vi \).

\noindent {\bf (Strict) serialisability (\SER).}
Serialisability is the strongest consistency model, 
requiring that there exists a sequential schedule of transactions. 
This prevents  the  kv-store in  \cref{fig:ser-disallowed}, since
whichever transaction writes first ($t_1$ or $t_2$) should be in the
view of the other. This example is allowed by all the other execution
tests in Figure~\ref{.}
The execution test $\ET_{\SER}$ requires 
clients to execute transactions only when their view of the kv-store 
store is complete.
