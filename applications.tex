    Short intro why it is good to use our models

    how we verify
}
Compared with graph-based models including dependency graphs and abstract executions,
our state-based model are useful for verifying implementations,
because many implementations embed notions of kv-stores and views.
For centralise databases, the state of the centralised server corresponds the kv-stores,
and the views reflects the initial local states that transactions work on.
For distributed databases, since most distributed databases satisfy eventual consistency, 
\ie servers among the system eventually agree on the state of the system,
and use last-write-win to resolve conflicts,
the final states of all servers collectively correspond to the kv-stores,
while views reflect the local states of servers.
