Clock-SI \citep{clocksi} is a partitioned distributed NoSQL database, 
in which each site, also called \emph{shard},
contains distinct partition of keys.
Clock-SI implements snapshot isolation with two versions:
a simplified version where each session contains only one transaction
and a full version where each session can have multiple transactions.
Here we verify the full version.

\paragraph{Notation.}
We pick the same letters for the concepts that have similar meaning with respect to those in our kv-store operational semantics,
and annotate them with \emph{tilde}, for example, Clock-SI key-value store \( \clockkvs \).
