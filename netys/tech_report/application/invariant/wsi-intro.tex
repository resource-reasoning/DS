We introduce a general condition on the shape of kv-stores,
which guarantees the robustness against \( \WSI \).
We then apply this condition to prove two libraries,
a multi-counter library and a banking library \citep{bank-example-wsi},
are robustness against \( \WSI \) and hence any stronger models such as \( \SI \).
