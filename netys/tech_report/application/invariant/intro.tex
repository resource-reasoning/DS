We use our operational semantics to prove invariant properties of several client programs.
One important properties is robustness in the sense that
the invariant of a client program \( \prog \) obtained by executing under a weak consistency model,
can be obtained by executing the same program \( \prog \) under serialisability.
The correctness of many client programs can be derived from robustness.
This is because many client programs are designed with respect to serialisability.
We prove that a single counter library is robust against \( \PSI \).
We find a general pattern that grantees robustness against \( \WSI \) and thus any stronger models such as \( \SI \);
we use this pattern to for proving robustness of a multiple counter and a banking libraries.
While previous work on checking robustness \citep{giovanni_concur16,SIanalysis,laws,sureshConcur}
uses static-analysis techniques that cannot be extended to support client sessions, 
we give the first robustness proofs that take client sessions into account.
Last, specific client programs are correct although they are not robust.
For example, we prove that a lock paradigm is correct under \( \UA \), despite not robust.
