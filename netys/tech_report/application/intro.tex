We verify two implementation protocols using our semantics:
the COPS protocols, 
a full replicated distributed database that satisfies causal consistency;
and the Clock-SI protocol, 
a fully partitioned distributed database that satisfies snapshot isolation.
We have described the COPS protocol in \cref{sec:overall-cops}.
In \cref{sec:cops}
we provide a COPS operational semantics that, we believe, matches the COPS reference implementation.
We construct kv-store program traces from the COPS program traces,
and prove each transition in the encoding kv-store program traces satisfying
the execution test of causal consistency.
In \cref{sec:clock-si},
we then apply the same method to Clock-SI.
