We introduce our interleaving operational semantics for atomic transactions.
The abstract machine states of our semantics comprises two key concepts (\cref{sec:kvstore-view}):
\begin{enumerate*}
\item \emph{global}, centralised multi-versioning key-value stores (kv-stores), 
which are abstraction to states of databases,
and \item \emph{partial} client views, which are client observable states.
\end{enumerate*}
In \cref{sec:operational-semantics}, we present the rules of our operational semantics.
This semantics is parametrised by an \emph{execution test}, that give rise to a consistency model.
We then show examples of execution tests 
for many well-known consistency models in \cref{sec:consistency-model-on-kv}.
