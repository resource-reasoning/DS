\emph{Monotonic write} (\(\MW\)) \citep{session-guarantee,repldatatypes} states that if a client \(\cl\) sees 
a version of a key \( \key \) that was written by another client \(\cl'\), 
then it must see all versions of \( \key \) that were 
previously written by \( \cl' \).
In other words, the view \( \vi \) of the client \(\cl\) over a kv-store \(\kvs\) 
must be closed with respect to the relation \(\SO \cap \WW[\kvs]\), 
before \(\cl\) can commit a transaction;
this is modelled by \( \PreClosed(\kvs, \vi, \SO \cap \WW[\kvs]) \).
The resulting view can be any view thus \(\ViewShift[\MW]\) is simply \(\true\).
Monotonic write prohibits the kv-store in \cref{fig:mw-disallowed},
since transaction \( \txid \) reads the third version of \( \key_2 \) written by \( \txid[\cl](2) \),
but not version written by \( \txid[\cl](1) \) in key \( \key_1 \), 
where \( (\txid[\cl](1), \txid[\cl](2)) \in \SO \cap \WW[\kvs](\key_2) \).
