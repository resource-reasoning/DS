We show that how all the results illustrated so far 
can be put together to show that a consistency model 
using an execution test \( \et \) on kv-stores
is \emph{sound and complete} with respect to 
the declarative definition using visibility axioms \( \visaxioms \) on abstract.
This means that,
the set of kv-stores induced by \( \et \) for some programs \( \prog \) is compatible with
the set of abstract execution tests induced by \( \visaxioms \),
that is,
\( 
    \bigcup_{\prog \in \Programs} \EvalET{\prog} = \Set{ \XToK(\aexec)
                | \aexec \in \CMA(\visaxioms) } \).
Note that, our operational semantics talks about execution of some programs \( \prog \),
while the well-known declarative semantics only talks about fingerprints.
%We show that
%any trace obtained using \( \et \) can be simulated by a trace obtained using \( \visaxioms \), 
%and vice versa.
We introduce soundness and completeness constructors, which lift the conditions 
on execution tests \( \ET \) and visibility axioms \( \visaxioms \) with respect to single transitions
to the level of traces, and therefore to the level of reachable kv-stores and abstract exections.
