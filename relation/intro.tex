We prove the correctness of execution tests with respect to axiomatic definitions on abstract executions.
First we demonstrate that there is a bijection between our kv-stores and dependency graphs in \cref{sec:dgraph}.
In \cref{sec:aexec}, we give an alternative operational semantics on abstract executions.
Using the bijection between kv-stores and dependency graphs, 
and the connection between dependency graphs and abstract executions \citep{laws,SIanalysis}, 
in \cref{sec:equivalence-kvstore-aexec-semantics}, we demonstrate that connections between 
traces obtained by our semantics on kv-store and traces obtained by the semantics on abstract executions.
%Over the connection between traces of kv-stores and abstract executions,
In \cref{sec:sound-complete-constructor},
we define \emph{soundness} and \emph{completeness constructors} for proving the correctness of our definitions
of consistency models using execution tests.
Using these two constructors, 
we only need to prove an notion of \emph{soundness} and \emph{completeness}
between execution tests and the axioms on abstract executions,
and the constructors lift the result to the level of traces.
Finally, in \cref{sec:sound-complete-et},
we show that definitions of consistency models using execution tests defined in \cref{sec:consistency-model-on-kv} 
are sound and complete with respective to the definitions using axioms on abstract executions.
