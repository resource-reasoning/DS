\subsection{Worlds}

A \textit{world} is the structure that represents the entirety of the state of existing resources together with a way to describe how these can be modified. We now informally present all of a world's components and properties which are later formalised. A world is in fact a triple $(l, g, \mathcal{J})$ where:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The \textit{logical local state} $l$ represents the resources which are locally owned by a thread and are not externally accessible, i.e. no other thread can see nor update them.
\end{itemize}
