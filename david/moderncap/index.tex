\section{mCAP Model and Assertions}

In the following section we provide the first formalisation of the mCAP logic model (where the \textit{m} stands for \textit{modern}). This work builds upon the CAP program logic that was first introduced in \cite{cap} and borrows some of the definitions and proof strategies from CoLoSL \cite{colosl}. The main novelties introduced in mCAP, as compared to regular CAP, are concerned with freeing its usage as a logic from some hard constraints. mCAP is in fact parametric with respect to the region capabilities (or \textit{guards}) used, it allows multiple region updates at once through the repartitioning operation, and does not enforce the entirety of a region capability to be held in order to construct the region itself.
