\section{The mCAP Program Logic}

\label{sec:mcapModel}

In the following section we provide the first formalisation of the mCAP logic model (where the \textit{m} stands for \textit{modern}) and later of its semantics. This work builds upon the CAP program logic, presented in Section \ref{sec:cap} and first introduced in \cite{cap}, and borrows some of the definitions and proof strategies from CoLoSL \cite{colosl}. The main novelties introduced in mCAP, as compared to regular CAP, are concerned with freeing its usage as a logic from some hard constraints. mCAP is in fact parametric with respect to the region capabilities (or \textit{guards}) used, it allows multiple region updates at once through the repartitioning operation, and does not enforce the entirety of a region capability to be held in order to construct the region itself.

This work will serve as the foundation framework for the program logic for serializable transactions that we need. In fact, the latter will be a concrete instantiation of mCAP and will enable us to reason about systems adopting real transactional atomicity and later ones using \tpl\ to handle concurrency control.
