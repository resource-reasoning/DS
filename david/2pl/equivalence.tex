\subsection{Semantics Equivalence}

Serializability gives us an important consistency property on the \tpl\ operational semantics that we defined. In abstract terms, it allows us to think about program executions in some sequential order, without having to consider all possible interleavings that may arise. At this point, we want to show an even stronger result which is the semantics equivalence between the semantics defined in Section \ref{sec:2plSemantics} and some \textit{atomic} operational semantics, defined in this section, that reduce transactions in one go, as if the system stops when they begin execution and starts again when they are done. The equivalence not only allows us to forget about the peculiar locking details of \tpl\ and thus only to focus on \textit{atomic} reductions, but also provides us with soundness with respect to the mCAP program logic defined in Section \ref{sec:mcapModel}. This empowers us to build mCAP proofs of programs running under the \tpl\ semantics.
