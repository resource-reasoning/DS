	\section*{Acknowledgements}
	
	I would like to thank my supervisor, Philippa Gardner, for inspiring and guiding me through the course of this project. The regular meetings we had, always led to new and interesting questions around the topic and were filled with helpful feedback. A particular thanks goes to her wonderful research team members Shale Xiong, Julian Sutherland, Azalea Raad and Andrea Cerone, in no particular order. They were true companions in this journey and offered countless hours of their time to support my work. Their insights and suggestions have been of invaluable importance and I am extremely grateful for this.
	
	It goes without saying that I owe everything to my parents Tim and Cristina. Together with my sister Desideria, they have supported and unconditionally loved me throughout my four years at Imperial.
	
	Finally, this section would not be complete if I did not express my eternal gratitude to my hometown football club, A.C. Fiorentina, for giving me strong vital emotions every single week of my life.
