\chapter{Two-Phase Locking Semantics}

\label{sec:2plSem}

In order to formally describe the behaviours that arise from adopting \tpl\ as a concurrency control protocol for transactions, we extend the model presented in Section \ref{sec:transLogicMod}, by adding two new global constructs together with a way to keep track of the locking phase each transaction is currently in. These changes are necessary, since we need to enable a real interleaving of concurrent transactions at the level of single operations, and to introduce the concept of locking storage items.

Later on, we give meaning to program executions in this new environment by specifying a set of operational semantics rules, which are defined as a labelled transition system. They are formulated in way which enforces the two-phase rule dictated by the protocol.
