\chapter{Two-Phase Locking is Serializable}

The idea of enabling client reasoning around \tpl\ using the style proposed by mCAP is only feasible once we are able to prove the logic's soundness with respect to the operational semantics for two-phase locking. This objective will guide us through the entirety of this section that gradually defines and proves all of the necessary components. We take a multi-step approach in proving soundness, by first showing the equivalence between the \tpl\ semantics and the \textsc{Atom} semantics, where transactions are ran in one single step by reducing their body to termination. This result is achieved using a strategy that requires the serializability of two-phase locking, together with a set of properties that will be analysed in detail. Next, it is also shown that mCAP's original operational semantics, directly inherited from the Views framework \cite{views}, are able to replicate any execution that can happen through the \textsc{Atom} ones. We can now see how the entire strategy fits together and will be utilized to finally complete the soundness proof.
