\section{A Logic for Transactions}

This section is dedicated to the description of a program logic for transactions using the concepts that have already been introduced in **MCAP SECTION**. We start by formally defining what the rely and guarantee relations are for each thread. This allows us to describe the effects of a thread and of the environment on the current world. Such relations allow us to further state \textit{stability} for assertions and for predicate environments, a fundamental property to later on build our proofs. All of these components are then used to formalise the concept of \textit{repartitioning} \cite{cap}\cite{colosl} that logically represents a thread's atomic actions included in its guarantee relation.
