\subsection{Parallel Snapshot Isolation and Snapshot Isolation}
\sx{Need some citations here, what is geo-replicated, distributed database vs distributed system}
\emph{Snapshot Isolation} (SI) is a consistency model that has been widely employed in both centralised and distributed databases. 
Because snapshot isolation does not scale well to geo-replicated and distributed systems, a weaker model called \emph{Parallel Snapshot Isolation} (PSI) has been recently proposed. 

%\sx{
%Both SI and PSI can be specified in the history heap framework by combining the consistency models that we have already introduced. 
%In short, SI combines atomic visibility and the snapshot monotonicity property from consistent prefix property (if a transaction $\tsid_1$ 
%observes the effects of another transaction $\tsid_2$, then it also observes 
%the effects of any transaction that committed before), and the write-conflict 
%detection from Update Atomic (two committing transactions do not write 
%concurrently to the same location). In contrast, PSI only requires atomic 
%visibility, causal consistency and write-conflict detection. Formally, we have 
%the following:

Both SI and PSI can be specified in the history heap framework by combining the consistency models that we have already introduced. 
In short, SI combines consistent prefix property and update atomic, while PSI only requires causal consistency and update atomic.
\begin{definition}
The \emph{parallel snapshot isolation} combines causal consistency (\cref{def:causal})  and update atomic (\cref{def:update-atomic}): $\mathsf{PSI} = \mathsf{CC} \cap \mathsf{UA}$.
The {snapshot isolation} combines consistent prefix (\cref{def:consistent-prefix}) and update atomic (\cref{def:update-atomic}): $\mathsf{SI} = \mathsf{CP} \cap \mathsf{UA}$.
