Modern distributed databases weaken the data consistency guarantees 
%provided to clients 
to allow for faster transaction processing. 
%The introduction of weak consistency models in transactional systems 
It poses several challenges: formalising user-observable behaviour,
then reasoning about client applications 
and verifying protocols of databases.
We abstract databases to centralised multi-version key-value stores and 
clients have partial views of such stores.
%We propose an operational semantics for transactional models with  
%atomic visibility, and we compare it with previously declarative formalisms. 
Compared with previously declarative formalisms,
we propose an operational semantics that is parametric in the notion of execution tests, 
which determine if a client with a given view is allowed to commit a transaction,
%by tuning the execution test, 
hence to define different consistency models. 
%At the same time, our semantics retains most properties 
%that are standard in operational semantics of sequentially consistent system: 
%a global notion of state, atomic execution of transactions, and interleaving 
%semantics of operations. These properties are desirable because they enable 
%the compositional reasoning over clients of a system.
Using our semantics, 
we analyse the robustness of simple client applications 
against different consistency models and prove the correctness 
of protocols of distributed databases.
