We introduce an interleaving operational semantics for describing the
client-observable behaviour of atomic transactions on distributed
key-value stores. Our semantics builds on abstract states comprising
centralised, global key-value stores and partial client views. 
We provide operational definitions of consistency models for our abstract states  which
we show to be equivalent to the well-known declarative definitions
of consistency model on abstract executions. 
\begin{app}
We explore two applications, verifying that the COPS replicated database
and the Clock-SI  partitioned database satisfy their 
consistency models using trace refinement,
and proving invariant properties of client programs. 
\end{app}
