We introduce an interleaving operational semantics for describing the
client-observable behaviour of atomic transactions on distributed
key-value stores. Our semantics builds on abstract states comprising
centralised, global key-value stores and partial client views. 


.  We provide
operational definitions of consistency models for our key-value stores which
are shown to be equivalent to the well-known declarative definitions
of consistency model for execution graphs. We explore  two
immediate applications of our semantics: specific protocols of 
geo-replicated databases (e.g. COPS) and partitioned databases
(e.g. Clock-SI) can be shown to be correct for a specific consistency
model by trace refinement; % embedding them in our centralised semantics; 
programs can be directly shown to have invariant properties such as 
robustness results against a weak consistency model.
