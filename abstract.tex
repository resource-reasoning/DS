Modern distributed databases weaken  data consistency guarantees 
%provided to clients 
to allow for faster transaction processing. 
%The introduction of weak consistency models in transactional systems 
It poses several challenges: formalising user-observable behaviour;
then verifying protocols of databases and reasoning about client applications.
We abstract such databases to centralised multi-version key-value
stores
and 
client views which provide partial  information about such stores. 
%We propose an operational semantics for transactional models with  
%atomic visibility, and we compare it with previously declarative formalisms. 
%Compared with previously declarative formalisms,
We propose an operational semantics that is parametric in the notion
of {\em execution test}, 
which determines if a client with a given view is allowed to commit a
transaction. Different execution tests give rise to 
%by tuning the execution test, 
different consistency models, which are equivalent to the
declarative consistency models defined in the literature. 
%At the same time, our semantics retains most properties 
%that are standard in operational semantics of sequentially consistent system: 
%a global notion of state, atomic execution of transactions, and interleaving 
%semantics of operations. These properties are desirable because they enable 
%the compositional reasoning over clients of a system.
Using our semantics, we prove the correctness of distributed
protocols and analyse the robustness of simple client applications.
