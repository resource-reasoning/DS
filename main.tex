\begin{abstract}
Contents of this set of notes: 
History heaps. Semantics of Programs 
running under weak consistency models using history heaps as states. 
Simulation technique for comparing weak consistency models defined using 
history heaps. Verification of implementations.
\textbf{Points following Dagstuhl: Viktor seemed positive about the 
history heap work. His question was whether the framework is generic 
enough to capture the protocols that they are developing with Azalea. 
Alexey's opinion is that the framework may have some use if we 
manage to prove implementations of protocols correct. 
I would also like to have Azalea's opinion on a semantics based 
on history heaps.}
