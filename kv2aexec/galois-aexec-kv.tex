\subsection{Galois connection}
\label{sec:galois-kv-aexec}
Now we can prove \cref{thm:kvtrace2aexec}, which we rephrase in \cref{thm:kvtrace2aexec.app}.
The last statement in \cref{thm:kvtrace2aexec} implies that there is a \emph{Galois connection}
between the set of $\ET_{\top}$-traces, and the set of abstract executions that satisfy the 
last write wins policy. The lower and upper adjoints of this connection are the 
lifting of the functions $\aeset(\cdot)$ and $\KVtrace(\cdot)$ to sets of $\ET_{\top}$-traces 
and abstract executions, respectively. However, these two sets are not isomorphic: 
when converting a set of abstract executions into kv-traces, we abstract away the 
pairs $\txid \toEDGE{\VIS} \txid'$ in the visibility relation where $\txid$ is a read-only transaction.
When converting a $\ET_{\top}$-trace into a set of abstract executions, 
we (partially) lose the information about the views of clients immediately after it executed a transaction.

\begin{theorem}[Galois connection between kv-store trace and abstract execution]
\label{thm:kvtrace2aexec.app}
Given a $\ET_{\top}$-trace $\tr$, there exists a set of abstract executions $\aeset({\tr})$ 
such that $\lastConf(\tr) = (\mkvs, \_)$ for any $\mkvs \in \aeset(\tr)$.
Given an abstract execution $\aexec$ satisfying the last write wins resolution policy,
there exists a set of $\ET_{\top}$-traces $\KVtrace({\aexec})$ in normal form
such that $\lastConf(\tr) = (\mkvs_{\aexec}, \_)$ for any $\tr \in \KVtrace({\aexec})$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    It can be derived from \cref{prop:kvtrace2aexec} and \cref{prop:aexec2kvtrace}.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary} 
\label{cor:kvtrace2aexec}
$\CMs(\ET_{\top}) = \Set{\mkvs_{\aexec} }[ \aexec \text{ satisfies } \RP_{\LWW}]$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
    It follows by \cref{thm:kvtrace2aexec.app}.
\end{proof}
