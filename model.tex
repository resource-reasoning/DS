\section{Formal Model}
\label{sec:model}
%\label{sec:semantics}

%\ac{I am going to split this section into two, for the sake of clarity. 
%As of now, the structure that I have in mind for the paper is as follows: 
%Section 2 (i.e. this section) contains the notion of key-value store, view, snapshot, 
%execution tests, and consistency model  -i.e. sets of key-value stores- 
%induced by an execution test). Then Section 3 discusses 
%the semantics of programs, and possibly we state the result 
%of adequateness. In Section 4 we discuss the equivalence of consistency 
%models specifications with respect to axiomatic ones. In Section 5 
%we present the logic and litmus tests examples.}
