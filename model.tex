\section{Operational Model}
\label{sec:model}

\pg{Remember: section 3 is all about technical definitions; section 2
 is  about definitions. This saves space and clarifies the purpose of
 each section.}

We give the technical definitions of our operational model: 
the global, centralised key-value stores; the partial client views;  and the
operational semantics. 

\subsection{Key-value Stores}

Key-value stores are defined using client identifiers and transaction identifiers.
Let $\Clients \defeq \Set{\cl, \cl',\cdots}$ be a 
countably infinite set of \emph{client identifiers}. 
The set of \emph{transaction identifiers}, 
$\TxID \defeq  \Set{\txid_{0}} \uplus \Set{ \txid_{\cl}^{n} \mid \cl
  \in \Clients \wedge n \geq 0 }$, 
comprises an initialisation transaction 
 $\txid_0$ 
 and, for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$, an identifier $\txid_{\cl}^{n}$
which  identifies a transaction 
 committed by client $\cl$. Elements of $\TxID$ are ranged over by
$\txid, \txid', \cdots$, and subsets by $\txidset, \txidset', \cdots$. 
Let $\TxID_{0} \defeq \TxID \setminus \{ \txid_0\}$. 
The superscript $n$ records  the session order, $\PO$, associated with
the transaction and client: that is, 
$\PO \defeq \Set{ (\txid, \txid') \mid \exsts{ \cl, n,m } \txid =
  \txid_{\cl}^{n} \wedge \txid' = \txid_{\cl}^{m} \wedge n < m}$.
We write $\txid \xrightarrow{\PO} \txid'$ for
$(\txid, \txid') \in \PO$, and $\txid \xrightarrow{\PO ?} \txid'$ for
for its reflexive closure. 


\begin{definition}[Key-value Stores]
\label{def:his_heap}
\label{def:mkvs}
Assume a countably infinite set of \emph{keys} $\Keys = \Set{\ke, \ke', \cdots}$
and \emph{values} $\Val = \{\val, \val', \cdots\}$, including an
initialisation value    $\val_0 $.
A \emph{version} is a triple $\ver \in \Versions \defeq \Val \times \TxID \times \powerset{\TxID_{0}}$. 
A \emph{key-value store}, abbreviated to kv-store,  is a function $\hh: \Keys \rightarrow \Versions^{\ast}$, 
where $\Versions^{\ast}$ is the free monoid generated by $\Versions$. 
The \emph{initial}  key-value store is given by 
$\hh_{0}(\ke)\defeq  (\val_0, \txid_0, \emptyset)$ for
all $\ke \in \Keys$.



\end{definition}


A \emph{version} $\ver = (\val, \txid, \txidset)$ comprises  a value $\val$
and meta-data about the transactions that accessed it: the \emph{writer} $\txid$ identifies the transaction that wrote $\ver$;
and the set of \emph{readers} $\txidset$ identifies  the  transactions
that read from  $\ver$.
We write $\valueOf(\ver) \defeq \val$,
$\WTx(\ver) \defeq \txid$ and $\RTx(\ver) \defeq \txidset$. 
 Elements of $\Versions$ are ranged over by
$\ver, \ver',  \cdots$, and lists of versions (elements of $\Versions^{\ast}$) by $\vilist, \vilist',\cdots$.
Given kv-store $\hh$ and a transaction identifier $\txid$, we write 
$\txid \in \hh$ when $\txid$ appears as either the writer or reader of 
some version included in $\hh$.
%%%%
%%%%I don't think this technical detail is needed, it's clear
%%:  $\txid \in \hh \defeq 
%\exists \ke, i. 0 \leq i < \lvert \hh(\ke) \rvert \wedge (\txid \in
%\RTx(\hh(\ke, i)) \cup \{\WTx(\hh(\ke, i))\})$.
We also write 
$\hh(\ke, i)$ for the   $i$-th version of $\ke$ when defined, starting
from $0$ with  $i \geq 0$,   and $\lvert \hh(\ke) \rvert$ for   the length of
$\hh(\ke)$. 




We focus on key-value stores whose consistency model enforces the \emph{atomic visibility} of transactions~\cite{framework-concur}. 
This amounts to requiring that a transaction reads and writes at most
one version of each key.
We also assume that the list of versions for each key has an initial version carrying a default value $\val_0$, 
written by the designated initialisation transaction $\txid_0$ with an initial
empty set of readers.
Finally, we assume that the state of a key-value store is consistent with 
the session order of clients: a client cannot read a version of a key that has 
been installed by a future transaction within the same session;  and 
the order in which versions are installed by a single client must agree 
with its session order. When a 
kv-store satisfies  these conditions, we say that it is
\emph{well-formed}. 
Henceforth, we assume kv-stores are well-formed, and write  $\HisHeaps$ to denote 
the set of well-formed kv-stores.


\pg{Above, I've got rid of the technical details to make it more
  readable. I've also done a technical version, commented out, which
  should probably go in the appendix.}

%We focus on key-value stores whose consistency model enforces the
%\emph{atomic visibility} of transactions~\cite{framework-concur}.
%This amounts to requiring that a transaction reads and writes at most
%one version of each key: \textbf{(i)}
%$\fora{\ke, i, j} (o \leq i, j \leq \abs{ \hh(\ke) } \land
%\RTx(\hh(\ke, i)) \cap \RTx(\hh(\ke, j)) \neq \emptyset ) \implies i =
%j$, \textbf{(ii)}
%$\fora{\ke, i, j} (0 \leq i,j < \abs{ \hh(\ke) } \wedge \WTx(\hh(\ke,
%i)) = \WTx(\hh(\ke, j)) ) \implies i = j$.  We also assume that the
%list of versions for each key has an initial version carrying a
%default value $\val_0$, written by the designated initialisation
%transaction $\txid_0$: \textbf{(iii)}
%$\fora{\ke} \hh(\ke, 0) = (\val_0, \txid_0, \stub)$.  Finally, we
%assume that the state of a key-value store is consistent with the
%session order of clients: \textbf{(iv)}
%$\fora{ \ke, \cl, i,j, n, m} 0 \leq i < j < \abs{\hh(\ke)} \land
%\txid_{\cl}^{n} = \WTx(\hh(\ke,i)) {} \wedge \txid_{\cl}^{m} \in
%\Set{\WTx(\hh(\ke,j))} \cup \RTx(\hh(\ke, i)) \implies n < m $.  We
%say that kv-stores that satisfy the conditions
%\textbf{(i)}-\textbf{(iv)} above are \emph{well-formed}.  Henceforth,
%we always assume kv-stores are  well-formed, and  write 
%$\HisHeaps$ to denote the set of well-formed kv-stores.


\subsection{Client Views}

Clients often have a partial view of the key-value store, 
with different clients observing 
different version subsets  of the same key.
%To keep track of the versions observed by clients,
%we introduce the notion of \emph{client views} (\cref{def:view}). 

\begin{definition}[View]
\label{def:view}
\label{def:cuts}
\label{def:views}
\label{def:configuration}
A \emph{view} of a kv-store $\hh$ is a function
$\vi \in \Views(\hh) \defeq \Keys \to\powerset{\Nat}$ such that:
\begin{align}
    & \fora{ \ke } 
    0 \in \vi(\ke) 
    \wedge \fora{ i \in \vi(\ke) } 
    i < \abs{ \hh(\ke) } 
    \tag{well-formed}
    \label{eq:view.wf}\\
    & 
    \begin{array}{@{}l@{}}
    \fora{ \ke_1,\ke_2, i_1, i_2} 
	i_1 \in \vi(\ke_1)  \\
    \quad {} \land \WTx(\hh(\ke_1, i_1)) = \WTx(\hh(\ke_2, i_2))  \\
    \qquad {} \implies i_2 \in \vi(\ke_2)
    \end{array}
	\tag{atomic}
	\label{eq:view.atomic}
\end{align}
The initial view $\vi_{0}$ is defined as $\vi_{0}(\ke) = \{0\}$ for
each $\ke \in \Keys$. A \emph{configuration}, $\conf \in \Confs$  is a pair $ (\hh, \viewFun)$
with $\hh \in \HisHeaps$ and
$\viewFun : \Clients \parfinfun \Views(\hh)$. A configuration is an 
\emph{initial} configuration when $\hh$ is the initial key-value store
$\hh_{0}$. 
\end{definition}
%


In configuration $(\hh, \viewFun)$, the view of client 
$\cl$, given by $\vi = \viewFun(\cl)$ if defined,  determines, for each key $\ke
\in \Keys$, the sublist of versions in $\hh$
that the client can observe. If $i,j \in \vi(\ke)$ and $i < j$, then
the client knows about 
 the values and transaction meta-data associated with  versions
$\hh(\ke, i)$ and 
$\hh(\ke, j)$, and  knows that these versions are contained in 
 $\hh$ with  $\hh(\ke, j)$ more 
up-to-date than $\hh(\ke, i)$. 
Let $\Views = \bigcup_{\hh \in \HisHeaps} \Views(\hh)$ be the set of all views. 
Given a kv-store $\hh$ and two views $\vi, \vi' \in \Views(\hh)$, 
we write $\vi \viewleq \vi'$ when $\vi(k) \subseteq \vi'(\ke)$ for all $\ke \in \dom(\hh)$. 

Given configuration
$(\hh, \viewFun)$ and client $\cl$ such that $\viewFun(\cl)$ is
defined, it is possible to define a \emph{snapshot} of the
view $\viewFun  (\cl)$, which identifies the last write of a client
view. This definition assumes that the database satisfies the \emph{last writer wins}
resolution policy~\cite{}. It  is straightforward to generalise our work
to other resolution policies~\cite{.}.

\begin{definition}[Snapshot]
\label{def:heaps}
\label{def:snapshot}
A \emph{snapshot}, \( \ss \in \Snapshots  \defeq \Keys \to
\Val\),  is a function  from keys to values.
Given $\hh \in \HisHeaps$ and $\vi \in \Views(\hh)$, the \emph{snapshot} of $\vi$ in 
$\hh$ is defined by  $\snapshot(\hh, \vi) \defeq \lambda \ke \ldotp \valueOf(\hh(\ke, \max_{<}(\vi(\ke)))$, 
where $\max_{<}(\vi(\ke))$ is the maximum element in $\vi(\ke)$ with respect to the natural 
order $<$ over $\mathbb{N}$.
\end{definition}
Given a kv-store $\hh$, key $\ke$ and view $\vi$, we abuse
notation, writing 
$\hh(\ke, \vi)$ as a shorthand for 
$\hh(\ke, \max_{<}(\vi(\ke))$. Thus, $\snapshot(\hh, \vi) = \lambda \ke \ldotp \valueOf(\hh(\ke, \vi))$. 

\begin{remark}
The client view describes the partial history of  the database that is
observed  by
the client. The client snapshot describes the most up-to-date
information about the state of the database known to the client. 
It is not possible to work with just the 
snapshot. The client view is essential to 
to express some of the standard consistency models (see
Section~\cref{........}). 
\end{remark}


\subsection{Operational Semantics}

\noindent {\bf Programming Language} A 
\emph{program} \( \prog \) comprises a finite number of clients,
where each client is associated with a unique identifier \( \thid \in \ThreadID \), 
and executes a sequential \emph{command} $\cmd$, given by the following grammar:
\begin{align*}
\cmd & ::=  
\pskip \mid 
\cmdpri \mid  
\ptrans{\trans} \mid 
\cmd \pseq \cmd \mid 
\cmd \pchoice \cmd \mid 
\cmd \prepeat  
\\
\cmdpri & ::=  
\pass{\txvar}{\expr} \mid 
\passume{\expr} 
\\
\trans & ::=
\pskip \mid
\transpri \mid 
\trans \pseq \trans \mid
\trans \pchoice \trans \mid
\trans\prepeat    
\\
\transpri & ::= 
\cmdpri \mid
\pderef{\txvar}{\expr} \mid
\pmutate{\expr}{\expr} 
\end{align*} 
%

\pg{Why are you using $a$ for variable. Later you use $x$. Just be
  consistent. I'm happy with $x$.} 
Sequential commands  comprise $\pskip$,  primitive commands $\cmdpri
$, atomic transactions
$\ptrans{\trans}$,  and standard
compound commands. 
Primitive commands--the variable assignment
$\pass{\txvar}{\expr}$ and the assume statement $\passume{\expr}$
used to encode conditionals--are used for computations based on 
client-local variables 
and can hence be invoked without restriction. The 
transaction commands, $T$, 
comprise primitive commands, 
primitive transactional commands $\transpri$,  and standard compound commands. 
Primitive transactional commands---the lookup $\pderef{\txvar}{\expr}$ and the mutation 
$\pmutate{\expr}{\expr}$---are used for reading and writing to kv-stores respectively and 
can be invoked  as part of an atomic transaction $\ptrans{\trans}$.

A {\em program} is a finite partial function from client identifiers to sequential
commands.
%%%%I don't think this is needed. 
%$\prog = \Set{\thid_{1} \mapsto \cmd_{1}, \dots, \thid_{n} \mapsto \cmd_{n} $.
For clarity, we often write \( \cmd_{1}\ppar \dots \ppar \cmd_{n}\) as syntactic sugar 
for a program \( \prog \) with $n$ clients associated with identifiers
$\thid_1 \dots \thid_n$, where each client $\thid_i$ executes
$\cmd_i$. Each client is associated with its own client-local stack,  \emph{stack} 
$\stk \in \Stacks \defeq \Vars \to \Val$,  mapping program variables
ranged over by $\pvar{x}, \pvar{y}, \cdots$
to values. 
We assume a language of expressions built from values
and program variables, 
\( \expr ::= \val \mid \var \mid \expr + \expr \mid \dots  \).
The evaluation $\evalE{\expr}$ of  expression $\expr$ is parametric in
the client-local stack:
\begin{gather*}
\evalE{\val} \defeq
\val
\quad
\evalE{\var} \defeq
\stk(\var)
\quad
\evalE{\expr_{1} + \expr_{2}} \defeq
\evalE{\expr_{1}} + \evalE{\expr_{2}}
\quad
\dots
\end{gather*}
\pg{In above, you could define stack  $s_i$ for client $cl_i$.}

\noindent {\bf Transaction Semantics}  
In our framework, transactions are executed atomically. 
Roughly speaking, given a configuration $\conf = (\hh, \viewFun)$, 
when a client $\cl$ executes some transactional code $\ptrans{\trans}$, 
 it performs the following steps: 
it constructs a snapshot of $\hh$ from the view $\viewFun(\cl)$ that 
the client has over $\hh$;  it executes the code $\trans$ in isolation, using the 
snapshot constructed in the previous step as the initial, local state
of the client, and it determines the observable 
effects that such an execution has on the key-value store; and  it incorporates 
the effects of executing the code $\trans$ in the initial state determined by the snapshot into 
the key-value store.

We capture  the behaviour of a  transaction,
$\trans$,
by describing how it updates the client stack and snapshot of 
the kv-store and by  identifying   its {\em fingerprint set}.
A fingerprint of a transaction
is a set of read and write operations that describes  the 
reads of a snapshot of the kv-store taken  at the beginning of
the invocation of the transaction, and the writes to be
commited to the kv-store  as long as certain
consistency conditions are met. A transaction can have more than one fingerprint due to
non-determinism. 




\pg{Above  might need to dovetail with what we say in section 2. 
Maybe give an example that relates to
section 2 that shows intuitively how fingerprint works, maybnot not
and instead jsut refer to section 2}




\begin{definition}[Read-Write Set]
\label{beebop}
Let 
%The set of \emph{operations} is
$\Ops \defeq \{(l, \ke, \val) \mid$ $ l \in \Set{\otW, \otR} \land \ke \in \Keys \wedge \val \in \Val \}$ 
be a set of operations. 
A \emph{Read-Write Set} $\opset$ is a subset of operations, $\opset \subseteq \Ops$,
such that, for all $\ke \in \Keys$ and \( l  \in \Set{\otW, \otR} \),
if $(l, \ke, \val_1), (l, \ke, \val_2) \in \opset$ then $\val_1 = \val_2$.
\end{definition}
Note that we have placed a constraint that, per key, a read-write set
contains at most one read operation and at most one write operation.
This reflects the fact that we work with transactions that are
atomically visible~\cite{laws} meaning here that the reads are taken
from a snapshot of the kv-store and, since clients observe either none
or all effects of a transaction, only the last writes are 
committed.

We provide an operational description of the behaviour of a transaction command, $T$,
starting 
from an intial client stack
$s$, a snapshot $ss$  and the empty read-write set. 
%Intuitively,  a fingerprint of a transaction  records, for each key $\ke$,
%the first value a transaction reads (before a subsequent write) for $\ke$, 
%and the last value the transaction writes for $\ke$.
First, we define a transition system which describes how the stack and snapshot are updated  using the
primitive transaction commands.


\begin{definition}
\label{foo}
The transition system, $\toLTS{\transpri}\; \subseteq (\Stacks \times \Heaps) \times (\Stacks \times \Heaps)$, 
is defined by:
\[
\begin{rclarray}
(\stk, \h)  & \toLTS{\passign{\var}{\expr}}          & (\stk\rmto{\var}{\evalE{\expr}}, \h)                  \\
(\stk, \h)  & \toLTS{\passume{\expr}}                & (\stk, \h) \text{ where } \evalE{\expr} \neq 0        \\
(\stk, \h)  
& \toLTS{ \pderef{\var}{\expr} } 
& (\stk\rmto{\var}{\h(\evalE{\expr})}, \h) 
\\
(\stk, \h)
& \toLTS{\pmutate{\expr_{1}}{\expr_{2}}  }
& (\stk, \h\rmto{\evalE{\expr_{1}}}{\evalE{\expr_{2}}}) \\
\end{rclarray}                                                                                               
\]
\end{definition}
%Second, we define the basic actions of the primitive commands and
%primitive transactional commands using  function
% I don't like this name fingerprint function, it's not, the action
% might not be in the fingerprint. we only begin to get the
% fingerprint intruition with the composition operator. 
%we define a \emph{fingerprint function}, 
%$\func{fp}{\stub} \; : \Stacks \times \Heaps \times \transpri \rightarrow \Ops \cup \{\varepsilon\}$:
%

%Note that  the primitive commands are associated with the empty operation $\varepsilon$,
%as they only access the local stack and do not access the kv-store.

\noindent Second, we provide a 
function, $\mathsf{op}$,  connecting the  primitive transaction commands to the
basic read and write operations given in Definition~\ref{beebop}: 
\[
\begin{array}{rcl @{\quad} rcl}
\func{op}{\stk, \h, \passign{\var}{\expr}}          & \defeq & \emptyop                                     \\
\func{op}{\stk, \h, \passume{\expr}}                & \defeq & \emptyop                                     \\
\func{op}{\stk, \h,  \pderef{\var}{\expr}}           & \defeq & (\etR, \evalE{\expr}, \h(\evalE{\expr}))    \\
\func{op}{\stk,  \h, \pmutate{\expr_{1}}{\expr_{2}}} & \defeq & (\etW, \evalE{\expr_{1}}, \evalE{\expr_{2}})\\
\end{array}
\]
The  empty operation $\emptyop$ is used for the primitive commands which do not
contribute to the fingerprint.

Third, we define an operator,
$\addO  : {\cal P}(\Ops)\times \Ops\rightarrow {\cal P}(\Ops)$,  which
adds a  basic
operation to  a read-write set and ignores the empty operation: 
%For instance, when executing $ \ptrans{\trans}$ with $\trans \eqdef \transpri^1; \cdots ; \transpri^n$,
%the effect of each $\transpri^i$ is calculated via the $\op_i = \func{fp}{-, -, \transpri^i}$ function, 
%with the overall fingerprint given as the $\addO$-composition of the constituent effects: $\op_1 \addO \cdots \addO \op_n$. 
\begin{align*}
    \opset \addO (\etR, \addr, \val)  
    & \defeq
    \begin{cases}
        \opset \cup \{(\etR, \addr, \val)\} & \text{if } \for{l, v'} (l, \addr, v') \notin \opset \\
        \opset &  \text{otherwise} \\
    \end{cases}  \\
    \opset \addO (\etW, \addr, \val) 
    & \defeq 
    \left( \opset \setminus \setcomp{(\etW, \addr, v')}{v' \in \Val} \right) 
    \cup \Set{(\etW, \addr, \val)}  \\
    \opset \addO \emptyop  & \defeq  \opset  \\
\end{align*}
A read gets added to the read-write set if there is no read or
write there already, thus only  recording the reads of the
original snapshot of the kv-store at invocation. 
A write always updates the read-write set, corresponding to a
transaction only commiting the final writes.

\label{fig:semantics-trans}
\end{figure*}

Finally, we have all the ingredients to describe the behaviour of  a
transaction command.  \cref{fig:semantics-trans} provides the
one-step transaction semantics: the  interesting rule is the \rl{TPrimitive}
rule which describes how a primitive transactional command updates
the client stack, the snapshot and the read-write set; the other
rules are standard rules for compound commands. 



\begin{definition}[Fingerprint Set]
Given client stack $s$
and snapshot $ss$, the \emph{fingerprint set } of $T$ is given by 
\[F \defeq
\{\opset : (\stk, \h, \emptyset), T \toL^* (\stk', \h', \opset),
\pskip \}
\]
 where $\toL^*$ is the transitive closure of $\toL$ given
 in~\cref{fig:semantics-trans}.  A set $\opset$ in $F$ is called a
 \emph{fingerprint} of $T$. 
\end{definition}
\noindent It is straightforward to prove that the  fingerprints of $T$ contain at most one read operation per key and
one write operation per key. \\

\pg{Below, there were some minor inconsistences. Needs checking.I've
  made lots of changes. It's a bit difficult to assess by laptop,
  really needs a paper copy. Hope ok.}

\noindent {\bf Operational Semantics.} We give the operational
semantics of commands and programs. The command semantics describes
transitions of the form
$(\hh, \vi, \stk), \cmd \ \toT{\lambda}_{\ET} \ (\hh', \vi', \stk') ,
\cmd'$, stating that, given the kv-store $\hh$, view $\vi$ and stack
$\stk$, a client $\cl$ may execute command $\cmd$ for one step, updating the
kv-store to $\hh'$, the stack to $\stk'$, and the command to its
continuation $\cmd'$.  The label $\lambda$ is either of the form
$(\cl, \iota)$ denoting that client $\cl$ used a primitive command
that did not require access to the kv-store, or
$(\cl, \vi'', \opset)$ denoting that client $\cl$ commited an atomic
transaction with fingerprint $\opset$ under the view $\vi''$.
Transitions are parametric in the choice of \emph{execution test},
$\ET$,  used to capture well-known consisitency models studied in the literature
(Sections~\ref{4}
and~\ref{5}). 

\pg{Sorry, I think it's better to revert back to the judgement $cl
  \vdash (\hh, \vi, \stk), \cmd \ \toT{\lambda}_{\ET} \ (\hh', \vi', \stk') ,
\cmd'$, please change everywhere. Why is the label needed? It's not clear.}

\caption{Rules for primitive  commands, atomic
  transactions and programs.}
\label{fig:semantics}
\end{figure*}



Figure~\ref{.} contains the rules for primitive commands and atomic
transactions.  The rules for the compound commands are straightforward
and given in the appendix.
The rule for primtive commands, $\rl{CPrimitive}$,  uses the transition
system
 $\toLTS{\transpri}$, given in  Definition~\ref{foo}, applied to the primitive
commands which just affect the client stack. The rule for atomic
transactions, \rl{CAtomicTrans}, describes the execution of an atomic 
transaction under execution test $\ET$.  The first premise
states that the current view $\vi$ of the executing command maybe advanced to a newer atomic view $\vi''$ (see \cref{def:views}). 
The semantics only allows to advance the view to later versions, which corresponds to \emph{monotonic read} \cite{.......}.
Given the new view $\vi''$, the transaction proceeds by obtaining a snapshot $\sn$ of the kv-store $\hh$, and executing $\trans$ locally to completion ($\pskip$), updating the stack to $\stack'$, while accumulating the fingerprint $\opset$. Note that the resulting snapshot is ignored (denoted by $\stub$) as the effect of the transaction is recorded in the fingerprint $\opset$. 
%

The transaction is now ready to commit. The rule picks a fresh
transaction identifier using $\txid \in \nextTxId(\cl, \hh)$, judges
whether the commit is permitted by $\ET$ using the relation
$\ET \vdash (\hh, \vi'') \triangleright \opset : \vi'$, and updates
the kv-store using $\updKV{\hh, \vi, \txid, \opset}$.  The
set $\nextTxId(\cl, \hh)$ provides the  transactions identifiers
associated with $\cl$ that are fresh for  $\hh$:
$
\nextTxId(\cl, \hh) \defeq \Setcon{\txid_{\cl}^{n}}{\fora{m}
  \txid_{\cl}^{m} \in \hh \Rightarrow m < n }.
$
 By construction, all
elements of $\nextTxId(\cl, \hh)$ are greater, with respect to session
order $\xrightarrow{\PO}$,  than any transaction identifier previously
used by $\cl$. The judgement $\ET \vdash (\hh, \vi'') \triangleright
\opset : \vi'$
states that the fingerprint $\opset$ is compatible with kv-store $\hh$
and client view $\vi''$, and the resulting view  is $\vi'$. In
Section~\ref{4}, 
we give many examples of such relations.
Finally, we need to address how a fingerprint  $\opset$ of a
transaction executed
by client $\cl$  with view $\vi$  update a  key-value store $\hh$. 




Having selected a suitable transaction identifier $t$, we push the
fingerprint $\opset$ 
into $\hh$ as follows: for each read operation $(\otR, \ke, \_) \in \opset$, we add $t$ 
to the set of readers of the last version of $\ke$ that is included in the view $\vi$ of the client; 
for each write operation $(\otW, \ke, \val)$, we append a new version $(\val, t, \emptyset)$ 
to the tail of $\hh(\ke)$.
In the definition below, we use $\lcat$ to denote the concatenation of two lists; 
if $\vilist = \ver_0, \cdots, \ver_n$ and $i=0,\cdots,n$, 
$\vilist\rmto{i}{\ver}$ denotes the updated list 
$\vilist' = \ver_0, \cdots, \ver_{i-1}, \ver, \ver_{i+1}, \cdots,
\ver_{n}$. 

\begin{definition}[Transaction Update]
Let $\hh \in \HisHeaps, \vi \in \Views(\hh)$, $t \in
\TxID_{0}$ and 
$\opset \subseteq \powerset{\Ops} $.  
The transaction update function,  $\updateKV(\hh, \vi, \txid, \opset) $,  is
defined by:
\begin{align*}         
    & \updateKV(\hh, \vi, \txid, \emptyset) \defeq  \hh \\
    & \updateKV(\hh, \vi, \txid, \opset \uplus \Set{(\otR, \ke, \val)}) \\
    & \quad \defeq 
    \begin{array}[t]{@{}l}
        \texttt{let} \ (\val, \txid', \txidset) = \hh(\ke, \max_{<}(\vi(\ke))), \\
        \vilist = \hh(\ke)\rmto{\max_{<}(\vi(\ke))}{(\val, \txid', \txidset \uplus \{ t \})}\\
        \quad \texttt{in} \ \updateKV(\hh\rmto{\ke}{\vilist}, \vi, \txid, \opset)
    \end{array} \\
    & \updateKV(\hh, \vi, \txid, \opset \uplus \Set{(\otW, \ke, \val)} ) \\
    & \quad \defeq 
    \begin{array}[t]{@{}l}
        \texttt{let } \hh' = \hh\rmto{\ke}{ ( \hh(\ke) \lcat (\val, \txid, \emptyset) ) } \\
        \quad \texttt{in } \updateKV(\hh', \vi, \txid, \opset)
    \end{array}  
\end{align*}
For client $\cl$, given $\hh \in \HisHeaps$, $\vi \in \Views(\hh)$ and 
$\opset \subseteq \powerset{\Ops} $, the transaction update set 
for $\cl$ is 
\begin{align*}
&\updateKV(\cl,\hh, \vi, \opset)  \\
 & \quad \defeq \Setcon{\updateKV(\hh, \vi, \txid, \opset)}{\txid \in
    \nextTxId(\hh, \cl)}
\end{align*}
\end{definition}

\pg{In above, can the layout be better? I'm not sure where
  you use the transaction update set for cl, note change of argument
  order because I couldn't bear it:-) for the transaction update
  funtion, I would like to put the transaction identifier $t$ at the
  end of the arguments, since this is what's happening in the
  premises.}

Note that,  under the assumption that read-write set  $\opset$ contains at most one read and one write 
operation per key and the identifier is fresh for $\hh$, 
the transaction update function and the transaction update set for
$\cl$ are well-defined. 
Two read-write sets $\opset_1, \opset_2$ are \emph{conflict-free} if 
$\forall \ke \in \Keys.\; (\otW,\ke, \_) \in \opset_1 \implies \forall
\val \in \Val.\; (\otW, \ke, \val) \notin \opset_2$, and vice versa.
The commitment of two  conflict-free read-write sets 
$\opset_1, \opset_2$ into a key-value store $\hh$ does not depend on the order in which the commits 
are performed. 
\pg{I'm not sure about the last sentence. Can the view of one can be
  affected by the other? Also, I'm not sure if this is the right place
to put this. The command semantics is with respect to one cl, the
program semantics is about the cl changing over the many-step
relation, so may be its betterafter the program rule?}


Figure~\ref{.} also contains the rule for programs. 
A \emph{client environment}, $\thdenv \in \ThdEnv$, is a function  from client identifiers to stacks. 
We assume that the domain of client environments  is the same as the
the domain of the program throughout the execution: 
that is,
$\dom(\thdenv) = \dom(\prog)$.
Program transitions are simply defined in terms of the transitions of
their constituent client commands. 
This  yields a  standard interleaving semantics for concurrent
programs:
that is, 
a client performs a reduction in an atomic step without
affecting other clients. 
\pg{This last bit surely must link to the conflict-free comment earlier? I
  don't like the notation $\thdenv $, nothing else looks like this and
it's not as important as the notation suggests.}








\section{Consistency Guarantees}


Intuitively, a consistency model can be thought as a property on key-value stores 
defining the degree of consistency of the data stored in it.
From a formal point of view, we define a consistency model 
$\CMs$ to be a set of key-value stores.  
Each $\hh \in \CMs$ represents a possible outcome that 
can be obtained as the result of multiple clients committing several transactions each. 
However, depending on the particular consistency model being considered, the set of transactions that a client is allowed to commit  
from a configuration $\conf$, must be restricted to those whose effects comply with the data-consistency guarantee associated with 
the consistency model. 
To this end, we introduce the notion of \emph{execution tests}, 
execution tests are used to determine whether a client may commit a transaction into a key-value store.

\subsubsection{Execution Tests}
An execution test of a transaction is a quadruple $(\hh, \vi, \opset, \vi')$, where $\hh$ denotes a kv-store;
the $\vi$ denotes the \emph{initial} view, recorded at the beginning of the transaction; 
the $\opset$ denotes the fingerprint of the transaction; and 
$\vi'$ demotes the \emph{final} view of the transaction, obtained after committing the transaction. 
An execution test $(\mkvs, \vi, \opset, \vi')$ states that when the kv-store is described by $\hh$, a client with view $\vi$ is allowed to execute a single transaction with fingerprint $\opset$, commit the transaction and obtain an updated view $\vi'$. 

\begin{definition}
\label{def:execution.test}
An \emph{execution test} is a set of tuples $\ET \subseteq \HisHeaps \times \Views \times \powerset{\Ops} \times \Views$ 
such that for all $(\hh, \vi, \opset, \vi') \in \ET$:
\begin{align}
    & 
    \begin{array}{@{}l@{}}
    \fora{\otR, \ke, \val} (\otR, \ke, \val) \in \opset \\
    \quad {} \implies 
    \hh(\ke, \max{}_{<}(\vi(\ke))) = \val  
    \end{array}
    \tag{Ext} \label{eq:read-external} \\
    & 
    \begin{array}{@{}l@{}}
    \fora{\ke} \vi(\ke) \neq \vi'(\ke) \\
    \quad {} \implies
    ( (\otR, \ke, \_) \in \opset \vee (\otW, \ke, \_)) \in \opset) 
    \end{array}
    \tag{ValidViewUpd} \label{eq:valid-view-update}
\end{align}
\end{definition}

Execution tests enforce last write win,
\ie a transaction always reads the most recent writes from the initial view (\cref{eq:read-external}).
For minimum footprint on the views, a transaction is only allowed to update the view for those keys that have been read or overwritten (\cref{eq:valid-view-update}).


Hereafter, we adopt a more suggestive notation and write $\ET \vdash (\hh, \vi) \triangleright \opset: \vi'$ 
for $(\hh, \vi, \opset, \vi') \in \ET$.
Execution tests induce \emph{consistency models} \( \CMs(\ET) \) as defined in \cref{def:reduction,def:cm}.

An example of execution test is serialisability (\SER).
The execution test for \( \SER \) requires the initial view  \( \vi \) contains all the versions in the key-value store \( \mkvs \), that is, \( \fora{\ke, i < \abs{\mkvs(\ke)} } i \in \vi(\ke)\).
It matches the intuition that a transaction should observe the up-to-date state of the database.
Later in \cref{sec:spec} we present more examples of execution tests of well-known consistency models in the literature.

\end{figure*}

\input{\RootPath/specs/anomalies-fig.tex}

We now give the execution tests for widely adopted consistency models of distributed and replicated databases. 
These are summarised in \cref{fig:execution.tests}.
Following \cite{distrprinciples}, we distinguish between client-centric and data-centric consistency models. 
The former constrain the versions of keys that individual clients can observe. 
The latter impose conditions on the shape of the state of the database, in our case the structure of the kv-store.
In \cref{sec:spec-proof} we prove that specification of consistency models using execution tests
are both sound and complete with respect to alternative specifications from the literature.
Due to space constraints, we only give examples of allowed and disallowed key-value stores for relevant consistency models. 

\paragraph{Monotonic Reads ($\MRd$).}
It ensures that read operations from subsequent transactions always return a more up-to-date versions.
For example, the key-value store of \cref{fig:mr-disallowed} is disallowed by $\MRd$.
Because the client $\cl$ first observes the latest version of $\ke$ in $\txid_{\cl}^{1}$,
then it observes the initial version of $\ke$ in $\txid_{\cl}^{2}$.
The execution test $\ET_{\MRd}$ prevents this scenario by forcing clients to always update their views to newer ones. 

\paragraph{Monotonic Writes ($\MW$).}
It states that whenever a transaction observes the effects of a version installed by some client $\cl$,
then the transaction observes all the transactions executed by the client. 
It prevents the scenario of \cref{fig:mw-disallowed}, 
where transaction $\txid'$ observes the second version of $\ke_2$ carrying value $\val_2$, written by client $\cl$;
but it does not observe the second version of $\ke_1$ carrying value $\val_1$, previously written by the same client.
The execution test $\ET_{\MW}$ (\cref{fig:execution.tests}) ensures that, prior to executing a transaction,
the set of versions included in the view of the client must be prefix-closed with respect to the relation $\xrightarrow{\PO}$.

\paragraph{Read Your Writes (\RYW).}
It states that a client must always be able to read any version of a key that was previously written by the same client.
This prevents the key-value store of \cref{fig:ryw-disallowed}. 
In the \cref{fig:ryw-disallowed}, the initial version of $\ke$ carries value $0$, 
and the client $\cl$ tries to increment the value of $\ke$ by $1$ twice.
For the first time, it reads the initial value $0$ and then installing a new version carrying  value $1$ within a single transaction.
However, since the client does not need to read its own writes, 
the client might read the initial value $0$ again in the second increment transaction \( \txid_\cl^2 \),
and install a new version carrying value $1$.
The Read Your Writes ($\RYW$) (\cref{fig:execution.tests}) enforces that after committing a transaction, 
a client includes all the versions it wrote.  

\paragraph{Write Follows Reads (\WFR).}
It states that if a client \( \cl \) writes some version $\ver$ in a transaction,
following  another transaction (or in the same transaction of) who reads of some version $\ver'$, 
then a transaction may observe version $\ver$ only if it also observes $\ver'$. 
The Write Follow Reads ($\WFR$) disallows the scenario of \cref{fig:wfr-disallowed} 
where a transaction $\txid$ observes the version $\ver_2$ of $\ke_2$ carrying value $\val_2$ written by client $\cl$,
but the same transaction $\txid$ does not observe the version of $\ke_1$ carrying value $\val_1$, read by $\cl$ prior to writing $\ver$. 
The execution test $\ET_{\WFR}$ (\cref{fig:execution.tests}) prevents this scenarios 
by enforcing a view includes all the versions previous read by some client \( \cl \), 
if the view already include a write from that client \( \cl \).

\paragraph{Causal Consistency (\CC).}
Causal Consistency requires that if a client observes a version $\ver$, 
then it must also observe any version $\ver'$ from which $\ver$ potentially depends \cite{cops}. 
The dependency here means session order and write-read relation.
For session order, it means when a view includes some effect from a client, 
it must include previous effect from the same client.
For write-read relation, it means when a view includes a transaction (the versions it write),
it must include all the writes that the transaction read from.
A necessary and sufficient condition is to enforce the four session guarantees $\MRd, \MW, \RYW$ and $\WFR$ \cite{session2causal}.
Therefore, we let $\ET_{\CC} = \ET_{\MRd} \cap \ET_{\MW} \cap \ET_{\RYW} \cap \ET_{\WFR}$. 

\paragraph{Update Atomic ($\UA$).}
This consistency model has been proposed in \cite{framework-concur}, 
though we are not aware of any implementation. 
However, many implemented consistency models can be obtained by strengthening Update Atomic.
Update Atomic disallows concurrent transactions writing to the same key. 
This property is known as \emph{write conflict detection}.
For example, $\UA$ prevents the key-value store of \cref{fig:ua-disallowed},
where two transactions $\txid, \txid'$ concurrently increment the initial version of $\ke$ by $1$.
Note that this scenario generalises the one exhibited by $\RYW$, 
since we do not require $\txid, \txid'$ to be executed by the same client.
To prevent this scenario, the execution test $\ET_\UA$ requires that 
a client $\cl$ can write to key $\ke$ in a transaction,
only if its view prior to the execution includes the last version of $\ke$.

\paragraph{Consistent Prefix ($\CP$).}
\label{para:cp}
In centralised databases, where there is a total order in which transactions commit, 
Consistent Prefix is described by the following property: 
if a client observes the effect of a transaction $\txid$,
then it also observe the effect of any transaction $\txid'$ that commits before $\txid$.
It is difficult to formulate in key-value store,
because key-value stores do not contain the full information about the total order in which transactions committed. 
Inspired by dependency graph \cite{.....},
there are minimum observable transactions for each transaction derived from the following:
\[
    \SO  \subseteq  \VIS \qquad
    ( ( ( \SO \cup \WR ) ; \RW? )^* \cup \WW ) ; \VIS \subseteq \VIS
\]
where the \( R? \) is the reflexive closure of the relation \( R \) 
and \( R_1 ; R_2 \defeq \Setcon{(a,b)}{\exsts{c} (a,c) \in R_1 \land (c,b) \in R_2 } \) is the composition of the two relation.
The session order relation \( (\txid, \txid') \in \SO \) means the session order;
write-read relation \( (\txid, \txid') \in \WR \) means \( \txid' \) reads the write of \( \txid \);
read-write relation \( (\txid, \txid') \in \RW \) means \( \txid' \) read a old version of a key 
and \( \txid' \) installs a new version for the same key;
and \( (\txid, \txid') \in \VIS \) means the view exactly before \( \txid' \) should include all effect \( \txid \).
Given the minimum observable transactions, we can specify $\CP$. 
First, \( \SO \subseteq \VIS \) means a transaction observes all previous transactions from the same client,
and it is enforced by \( \ET_\RYW \).
Then the combination of \( \ddagger\) (\cref{fig:execution-tests}) and \( \ET_\MRd \) gives us \( ( ( ( \SO \cup \WR ) ; \RW? )^* \cup \WW ) ; \VIS \subseteq \VIS \).
Let consider a client \( \cl \) and the view \( \vi \).
Assume two transactions \( \txid, \txid' \)  such that \( \txid' \) is in the view \( \vi \) and \( \txid \toEdge{( ( ( \SO \cup \WR ) ; \RW? )^* \cup \WW )} \txid' \).
If \( \txid' \) is a transaction already observable by some previous transaction from the client \( \cl \), 
the transaction \( \txid \) must be observable by that time,
therefore by the \( \ET_\MRd \), the transaction \( \txid \) is in the current view \( \vi \).
Otherwise, if \( \txid' \) is a transaction that is first time observed by the client \( \cl \),
the \( \dagger \) predicate enforces \( \txid \) is also in the view \( \vi \).
Intuitively, the \( \CP \) disallows that a transaction observes updates in different order (\cref{fig:cp-disallowed-1}).
In \cref{fig:cp-disallowed-1}, transactions $\txid_{3}$ and \( \txid_4 \) observes updates in different order.
That is, \( \txid_3 \) observes that the update of $\ke_2$ carrying value $\val_2$ happens before the update of $\ke_1$ carrying value $\val_2$,
yet $\txid_{4}$ observes that the update of $\ke_1$ carrying value $\val_1$ happens before the update of $\ke_2$ carrying value $\val_2$. 
\paragraph{Parallel Snapshot Isolation (\PSI)} 
Parallel Snapshot Isolation (\PSI) can be obtained by combining causal consistency with update atomic, 
$\ET_{\PSI} = \ET_{\CC} \cap \ET_{\UA}$, and $\ET_{\SI} = \ET_{\CC} \cap \ET_{\UA}$.

\paragraph{Snapshot Isolation (\SI)}
When the total order in which transactions commit is known,
SI can be specified as the weakest consistency model that guarantees both 
Consistency Prefix and Update Atomic \cite{gsi,framework-concur}. 
Yet, it is not true in our framework, since transactions are not totally ordered.
For example, the kv-store of \cref{fig:si-disallowed} is included in both $\CMs(\ET_{\CP})$ and $\CMs(\ET_{\UA})$, 
but it is forbidden by snapshot isolation in general.
The reason is \( \CMs(\ET_1 \cap \ET_2) = \CMs(\ET_1) \cap \CMs(\ET_2) \) holds 
only under some conditions of the \( \ET_1 \) and \( \ET_2 \) (more detail in \cref{thm:et-comm} \cref{sec:et-comp}).
\footnote{%
    This problem is not limited to our setting: 
    because kv-stores are isomorphic to Adya's dependency 
    graph, the same problem arises there.%
} 
We are inspired by the following constraint that has been proven satisfying \( \SI \) \cite{cerone:snapshot}:
\[
    (\SO \cup \WW) \subseteq \VIS \quad  ( (\SO \cup \WW \cup \WR) ; \RW? ) ; \VIS \subseteq \VIS
\]
where write-write relation \( (\txid, \txid') \in \WW \) means the transaction \( \txid \) installs a version for a key \( \ke \) following by \( \txid' \) installing a new version for the key \( \ke \).
The constraint \( \SO \subseteq \VIS \) coincides with \( \ET_\RYW \).
The \( \WW \subseteq \VIS \) means two transactions cannot concurrently write to the same key,
which is enforced by \( \ET_\UA \).
Let consider \( ( (\SO \cup \WW \cup \WR) ; \RW? ) ; \VIS \subseteq \VIS \).
Similar to the argument we made in Consistent Prefix (\pageref{para:cp}), 
let assume a client \( \cl \), its view \( \vi \) and two transactions \( \txid, \txid' \) such that 
\( \txid' \) is in the view \( \vi \)
and \( \txid \toEdge{(\SO \cup \WW \cup \WR) ; \RW?} \txid' \).
If \( \txid' \) is observable by any previous transaction of the client \( \cl \),
then \( \txid \) is also observable before.
By \( \ET_\MRd\), it is the case \( \txid \) is in the view \( \vi \).
If \( \txid' \) is a new transaction observed by the client \( \cl \),
the \( \dagger \) enforces that \( \txid \) should be included \( \vi \).

\paragraph{(Strict) serialisability (\SER)}
Serialisability is the strongest consistency model, 
which requires that there exists a serial or sequential schedule of transaction. 
This prevents scenarios of \cref{fig:ser-disallowed},
which is instead allowed by all the other execution tests that we have presented.
The execution test $\ET_{\SER}$ requires 
clients to execute transactions only when their view of the key-value store is up-to-date.


------------------

\begin{definition}[$\ET$-reductions]
\label{def:reduction}
An \emph{action} $\alpha \in \Act$ has either the form $(\cl, \varepsilon)$, 
or $(\cl, \opset)$, 
where $\cl$ is a client and $\opset$ is a fingerprint. 
Given an execution test $\ET$, the $\ET$-\emph{reduction}, 
$\xrightarrowtriangle{}_{\ET} \subseteq \Confs \times \Act \times \Confs$, 
is the smallest relation such that for all $\vi, \vi', \cl, \hh, \hh', \viewFun, \opset$:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item 
    $
    \viewFun(\cl) = \vi 
    \wedge \vi \sqsubseteq \vi' 
    \implies (\hh, \viewFun) \xrightarrowtriangle{(\cl, \varepsilon)}_{\ET} 
    (\hh, \viewFun\rmto{\cl}{\vi'})$; and
	\item 
    $\viewFun(\cl) = \vi
        \wedge (\ET \vdash (\hh, \vi) \triangleright \opset: \vi')  
        \wedge \hh' \in \updateKV(\hh, \vi, \cl, \opset) \implies
	$  \\
	\phantom{a} \hfill 
	$(\hh, \viewFun) \xrightarrowtriangle{(\cl, \opset)}_{\ET} (\hh', \viewFun\rmto{\cl}{\vi'})$
\end{enumerate}
Given an execution test $\ET$, an \emph{$\ET$-trace} is a sequence of $\ET$-reductions of the form $\conf_{0} \xrightarrowtriangle{\alpha_{0}}_{\ET} \cdots 
\xrightarrow{\alpha_{n-1}} \conf_{n}$.
\end{definition}

\subsubsection{Consistency Models}
Consistency models are computed from execution tests by closing the set of initial key-value stores with respect to two operations: 
\begin{enumerate*}[label=(\arabic*)]
	\item advancing the view of a client; and 
	\item committing a fingerprint of a transaction. 
\end{enumerate*}
Lastly, consistency models induced by execution tests are \emph{monotonic} (\cref{prop:mono-et}).

\begin{definition}[Consistency Models]
\label{def:cm}
Given an execution test $\ET$, the set of configurations induced by $\ET$ is given by:
\[
\Confs(\ET) \defeq \Setcon{ \conf}{ \exsts{\conf_0} \conf_0 \text{ is initial } \wedge \conf_0 \xrightarrowtriangle{\stub}_{\ET} \cdots \xrightarrowtriangle{\stub}_{\ET} \conf }
\]
The \emph{consistency model} induced by $\ET$ is:
\( 
\CMs(\ET) \defeq \Setcon{ \hh }{ (\hh, \stub) \in \Confs(\ET) }
\)
\end{definition}



\begin{proposition}
\label{prop:mono-et}
Let $\ET_1 \subseteq \ET_2$. Then $\CMs(\ET_1) \subseteq \CMs(\ET_2)$.

\begin{definition}
Two triples $(\cl_1, \opset_1)$ and $(\cl_2, \opset_2)$ are 
conflicting if either $\cl_1 = \cl_2$, or there exists a key $\ke$ such that 
$(\otW, \ke, \_) \in \opset_1, (\otW, \ke, \_) \in \opset_2$. 

An execution test is $\ET$ is \emph{commutative} if, whenever $(\cl_1, \vi_1, \opset_1)$, 
$(\cl_2, \vi_2, \opset_2)$ are non-conflicting, and $\vi_1, \vi_2 \in \Views(\hh_0)$,  
then for any $\hh_0, \hh', \viewFun, \viewFun'$ we have that 
\[
\begin{array}{lr}
(\hh_0, \viewFun) \xrightarrowtriangle{(\cl_1, \opset_1)}_{\ET} 
\_ \xrightarrowtriangle{(\cl_2, \opset_2)}_{\ET} (\hh', \viewFun') &\implies \\
(\hh_0, \viewFun) \xrightarrowtriangle{(\cl_2, \opset_2)}_{\ET} 
\_ \xrightarrowtriangle{(\cl_1, \opset_1)}_{\ET} (\hh', \viewFun')
\end{array}
\]
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
An execution test $\ET$ has \emph{no blind writes} if, whenever $\ET \vdash (\hh, \vi) \triangleright \opset \cup \{(\otW, \ke, \_)\} : \vi'$, 
then $(\otR, \ke, \_) \in \opset$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
An execution test $\ET$ has \emph{minimum footprints} if for any key-value store \( \hh \)
views \( \vi, \vi',\vi''\) and fingerprint \( \f \),
\[
\begin{array}{@{}l@{}}
    ( \fora{ \ke} (\stub, \ke, \stub) \in \f \implies \vi(\ke) = \vi'(\ke) ) \land {} \\
    \quad \ET \vdash (\hh, \vi) \triangleright \opset : \vi'' \implies \ET \vdash (\hh, \vi') \triangleright \opset : \vi''
\end{array}
\]
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
An execution test $\ET$ has \emph{continuous post-views} if for any key-value store \( \hh \)
views \( \vi, \vi',\vi''\) and fingerprint \( \f \), 
\[
\begin{array}{@{}l@{}}
    \quad \ET \vdash (\hh, \vi) \triangleright \opset : \vi' \land \vi' \sqsubseteq \vi'' \implies \ET \vdash (\hh, \vi) \triangleright \opset : \vi''
\end{array}
\]
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}                                                                            
Let $\ET_1, \ET_2$ be two execution tests has no blind writes, minimum footprints and continuous post-views.
If $\ET_1$ is commutative, 
then $\CMs(\ET_1 \cap \ET_2) = \CMs(\ET_1) \cap \CMs(\ET_2)$. 
Furthermore, if $\ET_1, \ET_2$ are commutative, then $\ET_1 \cap \ET_2$ 
is commutative.
